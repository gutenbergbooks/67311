<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br /><br />
BOATSWAIN JOE
</h3>

<p>
Tom Dennis sat on a printer's stool beside
a very dirty window which dimly illumined
his figure, and stared at the gloom
surrounding him.  His rawboned face was
dejected; his angular body slumped
despondently.  In his hand was a little sheaf of
papers.
</p>

<p>
It was five-thirty in the afternoon.  Long
since, the grist of evening papers had gone
through the big press; the rollers had been
washed and retired; the men had gone home.
It was Saturday night, and the week's work
was done.  So was <i>The Marshville Clarion</i>,
as Tom Dennis cheerlessly admitted to
himself.
</p>

<p>
The high-school lad who assisted Dennis
in gathering local items and filling the
columns of <i>The Clarion</i> had not returned
as usual from the Saturday baseball game to
write up his notes from a fresh memory.
Dennis had instructed him not to return
until Monday&mdash;and not to return then unless
sent for.
</p>

<p>
Silence and the darkness of departing day
lay funereally upon the big back room.
Presses and stones and type-racks filled the
floor.  Always dingy and dark, this room
now seemed to feel the approach of dissolution.
The smell of printing-ink hung upon
the air like incense strewn by dead hands.
<i>The Clarion</i> had issued its own obituary.
</p>

<p>
Tom Dennis suddenly moved.  To the
dim light of the unwashed window he held
the papers in his hand.  They were bills.
Each of them was stamped "Paid".  As
he looked at them, Tom Dennis uttered a
mirthless bitter laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Paid!" he said, his voice ringing hollowly
in the emptiness of the big back room.
"Paid, by heavens&mdash;and not a cent to spare!
And the bank holds a mortgage on this
plant!  I can sell the typewriters for fifty
dollars; I'll have to do it to get out of
town!"
</p>

<p>
The outer door, the door of the front
office, banged, and there was a heavy tread
that ceased abruptly.  Tom Dennis paid no
heed to it; he sensed that someone had
entered, but it was of no concern to him
what passed in the outer office.
</p>

<p>
"Done!" he said morosely.  "I'm done!
It's been the dickens of a pull, this year
has&mdash;and now I'm done."
</p>

<p>
He was right: he was done, and he knew it.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Every newspaper man dreams of running,
some day, a paper all his own, dreams of
taking over some "small-town" paper,
dreams of running it his own way and
indulging his own ideas of how a paper
should be run, dreams of wealth and fame
in consequence.  Once in a thousand cases,
perhaps, the dream comes true.
</p>

<p>
Tom Dennis was at the end of his own
particular dream.  A college man, a star
reporter on a Chicago daily, he had saved
his money, and, at twenty-three, had become
the owner of <i>The Clarion</i> in the sleepy
little town of Marshville.
</p>

<p>
A meteoric year had ensued.  Tom Dennis
had gone to work to wake up Marshville&mdash;and
he had succeeded.  He had wakened
Marshville to a lively animosity, a deadly
resentment that a stranger should come in
here and give advice.  Marshville knew that
it was a sleepy, dying, vicious, ingrowing
little town&mdash;and Marshville wanted to be
just that kind of town!  So, when Tom
Dennis tried to root out the viciousness
and decay, Marshville was angered.
</p>

<p>
Six months passed, and the last of Tom
Dennis' money was gone.  He mortgaged
the whole property, lock, stock, and barrel,
and went on fighting.  He had gleams of
success, and the letters of Florence Hathaway
had inspired him to renewed efforts, but
now the end had come.  He must either
borrow on his personal credit, which was
not extensive enough to carry him very long,
or else go under.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "A smart Yankee packet lay out in the bay,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me way hay, o-<i>hi</i>-o!<br />
  A-waiting for a fair wind to get under way,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long time ago!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The voice&mdash;a musing rumbling voice&mdash;came
from the outer office, and it was a
voice strange to Tom Dennis.  But he scarce
heard the words, or the swinging air.  His
hand had clenched upon the sheaf of papers,
and his head had lowered.  Chin to breast,
he was in the agony of defeat; despite himself,
despite his rugged features, slow tears
were groping on his cheeks.
</p>

<p>
Those tears were not for himself, not for
the fact of his failure here.  A year ago
Tom Dennis would have taken his defeat
with a laugh and a joke, and he had not
changed.  It was not self-misery which drew
those man's tears to his cheeks.
</p>

<p>
He was thinking of Florence Hathaway.
He had found her here in the <i>Clarion</i> office
a year ago, a society reporter; she was then
supporting her slowly-dying mother.  Two
years previously her father, Captain Miles
Hathaway, had been lost at sea somewhere
in the Pacific; the girl had brought her
mother back to Marshville, the mother's
old home town, and there the mother had
died.  This had been three months after the
coming of Tom Dennis.
</p>

<p>
For another three months, Florence
Hathaway had stayed on with the
<i>Clarion</i>&mdash;largely for love of Tom Dennis.  Then
had come the offer of a teacher's position
in a private school in Chicago, and she had
accepted the offer.
</p>

<p>
Not that Dennis wanted her to accept&mdash;far
from it!  They had argued it all out that
night, under the willow trees by the river.
Her hand in his, the girl had made Tom
Dennis face a few hard facts.  She was the
rare kind who can make a man realize
things.
</p>

<p>
"Tom, dear," she had said gently,
"another year will see you firmly established
here in Marshville.  Until then we can't
dare marry; it isn't fair to you!  Get clear
of financial worries first.  Not that I care
about the money, Tom, but I do care so
much about you; and now you're talking
about mortgaging the paper, and it's bearing
you down."
</p>

<p>
"And if I fail?"
</p>

<p>
"Then come to me in Chicago, and we'll
start fresh&mdash;together."
</p>

<p>
"But why go there?  Stay here where you
can help me most!  It's your society stuff
that does most good&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No, dear, Marshville hates you; you
must conquer or be conquered, and you don't
know how terribly bitter Marshville can be.
It's like any small town, Tom.  They're
all against you now, and if I stay on the
paper, they'll be talking&mdash;about us.  Besides,
I don't like the place.  I want to be in Chicago
a little while, mistress of myself, enjoying
a little bit of real life and real things.  I'll
come back to you here, or you'll come to
me there, Tom, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Now, as he sat in the dingy back room,
Tom Dennis thought over these things, and
his pride revolted within him.  He could
not go back to his old job, admitting that
he had made a failure of his paper, admitting
that he was good for nothing better than a
reporter's job.  He could not go to Florence
Hathaway&mdash;a failure!  He had tasted of
freedom, and now it seemed to him that a
reporter's was a dog's life.  He would not
go back to it.  He would not ask her to face
it all, even though she might be willing&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "We didn't get a drink for seventeen days,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me way hay, o-<i>hi</i>-o!<br />
  And nobody cared if she hung in stays,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A <i>long</i> time ago!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Dimly the words penetrated the consciousness
of Tom Dennis, roused him slightly.
Who was in the outer office?  Well, no
matter.  The bank owned it now&mdash;tight-lipped
old banker Dribble up the street,
who owned everything.
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't a fair fight, maybe," muttered
Tom Dennis, sudden storm in his eyes.
"They lied to me right and left.  The
advertising contracts were faked on me.
They tried to stab me in the back whenever
they had a chance&mdash;and they did it, too!
But there's no use sobbing over all that."
</p>

<p>
He would have to leave town, of course&mdash;the
sooner the better.  He might as well
take the evening train to Chicago and make
his plans to start afresh.  There was nothing
to hold him here; everything was paid,
even to the interest on the mortgage.  The
mortgage still had six months to run.
</p>

<p>
"Why not?"  Dennis suddenly came to
his feet.  "I can shut up this coop, and
they can't touch it for six months!  The
property may deteriorate, of course; mice
will eat the rollers, and the ink will dry up,
and the presses won't be oiled&mdash;but that's
old Dribble's lookout, not mine!  I still
have six months left!  A stroke of luck&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ahoy, matey!" billowed a voice.  "Ahoy,
Dennis!  Where are you, skipper?"
</p>

<p>
A monstrous voice was that, a roaring
thunderous voice that filled the dingy old
back room with rolling waves of sound.
Startled, Tom Dennis reached to the nearest
electric bulb, switched it on, and directed
the light toward the door of the outer office.
</p>

<p>
There, standing in the doorway, he saw
a surprising figure.  The stranger was two
inches taller than Dennis, who himself stood
six feet one.  Not particularly well dressed
was the intruder&mdash;rough blue serge, manifestly
hand-me-downs, and a white soft shirt
with loosely-knotted cravat.  But the
face&mdash;the face was the thing!
</p>

<p>
A peculiar face it was, for in it was
emphasized the trait common to most men.
Its left side was regular enough.  The right
brow, however, was uptwisted satanically;
the right side of the mouth was down-twisted
in a leer.  Seldom had Tom Dennis
seen this dissimilarity between the two sides
of a man's face so pronounced.  Aside from
this, it was a massive strong face, lighted
by two very direct, piercing, predatory eyes
of light-blue, and crowned by flaming red hair.
</p>

<p>
"Ha!" said the stranger, coming forward.
"You're Dennis?"
</p>

<p>
"You're right."  And a sour smile twisted
the lips of the newspaper man.  "My name
is Dennis, right enough.  You've got another
bill to present?"
</p>

<p>
The other halted, and stared at him.
</p>

<p>
"Bill?" he repeated.  "Bill?  Paying your
bills, are you?"
</p>

<p>
Dennis laughed shortly.  "You bet.  I'm
clearing out of here to-night.  Well, how
much is it?  Guess I can scrape up enough
to pay it; if not, there's a typewriter out
in front you can take along.  Thought I'd
cleared 'em all off, though&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The stranger threw back his head and
laughed.  That laugh was a roaring billow
of sound, as though the red-head were
accustomed to fling his laughter into the
teeth of a singing gale.
</p>

<p>
"Ho-ho!" he cried boisterously.  "Slipping
your cable, hey?  Gone under, hey?  Another
poor swab who can't beat the shyster
law-clerks and has gone under!  Well, do what
I did, matey.  I was in the same boat myself,
oncet&mdash;and I run off to sea!  Strike me blind
if it wasn't the makin' of me!  Now, if
you'll take my advice and do the same
thing&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What do you want?" snapped Dennis
suddenly.  "I'm not asking for your advice,
my friend.  Have you business with me?"
</p>

<p>
"Aye."  The other came forward, hand
extended.  His voice was conciliating.
"Come, no harm done by a bit o' fun,
matey!  None intended, none took.  My
name's Ericksen; they calls me Boatswain
Joe, mostly, though I've got a quartermaster's
ticket in me oilskin.  I want a
bit o' talk, if you have the time."
</p>

<p>
"I'm rich in time," responded Dennis.
"Take a seat."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
As they shook hands, Dennis felt the
palm of Ericksen to be horny, rough with
great calluses; but the thumb lay over the
back of his own fingers with smooth
pressure.  A sailor, then, and one used to
handling lines!  That explained the odd
snatches of lingo.  But what was a sailor
doing here, in the middle of the United
States?
</p>

<p>
Ericksen eased himself up on a high
stool, stuffed loose tobacco from his pocket
into a pipe-bowl and struck a match.  His
piercing, arrogant, light-blue eyes surveyed
Tom Dennis with a comprehensive scrutiny.
</p>

<p>
"I hear," he said abruptly, a cloud of
smoke issuing from his lips, "I hear you
and Miss Hathaway are engaged to be
married."
</p>

<p>
His voice was still conciliatory, rather
bearing an air of a forced whine, and it
was entirely belied by those fierce
predatory eyes.  Tom Dennis flushed angrily.
</p>

<p>
"What are you driving at?" he demanded.
"What have my private affairs to do with
you?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't flare up, matey," responded the
other.  "I'm comin' to the p'int, steerin'
a safe course meantime.  'Keep an eye on
your charts, boatswain,' says the skipper,
'and look out for shoals among them
land-sharks.'  So I'm doin' it.  Of course, knowing
the inside of the country pretty well, comin'
from Wisconsin way like I do, I'm able to
navigate better'n the others would be; but
just the same, I'm mindin' my wheel mighty
close.  'No steerin' by the wind this cruise,'
says the skipper, and right he was."
</p>

<p>
This was all Greek to Tom Dennis.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what do you want with me?"
he reiterated.
</p>

<p>
"You answer my question, matey,"
returned the other calmly.
</p>

<p>
"None of your business, then," snapped Dennis.
</p>

<p>
To his surprise, Ericksen only chuckled
good-humouredly, and slapped his knee as
though at a good joke.
</p>

<p>
"I knowed it!  You are, right enough.
Goin' to Chicago to get spliced, maybe?"
</p>

<p>
The hand of Dennis closed on a printer's
key, but Ericksen interposed.
</p>

<p>
"Here, don't start no rumpus, matey!
You see, I got to know the chart before
I can lay my course.  Ain't that reasonable?
I got to this here town this afternoon,
lookin' for Miss Hathaway, and first one,
then another, tells me she's gone to Chicago,
but they don't know exactly where.  They
said to come here an' find you, you bein'
supposed to know for private reasons.  Ain't
that statin' it plain and unoffensive?  That's
me every time.  'Mind your jaw-tackle,
boatswain,' says the skipper.  'Be mild
an' gentle.'  And I am."
</p>

<p>
The sailor grinned.  So cheerful and
white-toothed was that grin, that Tom Dennis felt
impelled to laugh, but the arrogant, light-blue
eyes steadied him.
</p>

<p>
"You want Miss Hathaway's address&mdash;is that it?"
</p>

<p>
"Part of it, matey," responded Ericksen.
"Only part of it!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br /><br />
NEWS FROM NOWHERE
</h3>

<p>
Florence Hathaway was extremely
astonished when, upon Sunday morning, she
heard the voice of Tom Dennis on the
telephone, and received a request to join him
down-town for noon dinner.
</p>

<p>
"Come up to the school, Tom!" she
returned.  "You can dine in hall as my
guest.  And what brought you to town?"
</p>

<p>
"Can't talk now, Florence.  And I'll have
to refuse your invitation&mdash;because we'll all
three have to dine down-town.  Better make
it the 'Royton'; then we can have comparative
privacy."
</p>

<p>
"All three?" she echoed.  "Who's with you?"
</p>

<p>
"A man who has news of your father,
dear.  He's to join us at the 'Royton' at
one sharp, but I want to see you for a few
moments first.  Why not meet me at the
Art Institute about twelve-thirty?  I'll be
in the Japanese Room.  Believe me, it's
important!"
</p>

<p>
"News of&mdash;father?  Why, yes!  I'll be
there on time, Tom.  Japanese Room!"
</p>

<p>
So, at the hour when the galleries were
totally deserted, Tom Dennis was striding
up and down in the Japanese Room, past
the cases filled with lacquer ware.  In his
present mood of frowning meditation, his
features looked almost forbidding; they were
strong features, rugged with an uncompromising
virility.  Looking at them, one could
understand how this man, unaided, had
first worked his way through college and had
later gone to the top of an overcrowded
profession.
</p>

<p>
On time almost to the minute, Florence
Hathaway appeared.  Dennis met her at
the door, his hand to hers; a swift glance
around, and he bent his lips to hers.
</p>

<p>
"This way, dear!" he said, turning.
"There'll be no interruptions then."
</p>

<p>
Together they made their way outside
to one of the little balconies overlooking
the smoky park and lake front.  Brushing off
two of the chairs, Tom Dennis set them by
the stone rail.
</p>

<p>
"What on earth is it all about, Tom?"
asked the girl wonderingly.
</p>

<p>
"Me, first&mdash;then you," smiling he filled
his pipe and lighted it.  Then he set about
his tale, beginning with his own situation
of the previous afternoon, and passing on to
the coming of Boatswain Joe.  He described
his own hopeless case very bluntly and
frankly.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Florence Hathaway did not interrupt him,
but sat in silence, her eyes fastened upon his
rugged face, reading there the signs of his
past worries and failure.  They were fine
eyes, those that dwelt upon him with love
and tenderness.  An artist might have said
that they were too large for her face, that
their glowing brown depths held too passionate
a fervor, too calmly poised a radiance,
to match her almost colourless cheeks.  By
no rule could Florence Hathaway be adjudged
beautiful; and yet Marshville had missed
her more than all its other absent daughters
put together.
</p>

<p>
In her eyes, indeed, lay the brave and
tender soul of Florence Hathaway.  Frail
seemed her slender, almost girlish body;
yet one who gazed into her level eyes knew
that hers was an indomitable spirit&mdash;a heritage
perhaps, from that lost father whose iron
soul had battled the men and winds and seas
of half the world.
</p>

<p>
"Then you've left Marshville for good?"
she asked quietly when Dennis paused.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."  He nodded curtly.  "The place
will be shut for six months.  If I've not
returned by that time, if I've not struck some
lucky vein, old Dribble can foreclose his
mortgage and be blessed!  Of course, I'm
not gambling on striking it rich in a hurry;
it's just a long chance that still remains.
Well, now that's settled, let's get on about
your friend Ericksen.  You never heard
of anyone by that name?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  He may have known my father&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I'm coming to that.  Ericksen had come
from the Pacific Coast to find you&mdash;in
person; mark that down as Point One, upper
case!  Why in person, when a letter or
telegram would have fetched you?  Point
One&mdash;Query!  I don't like that fellow's
looks.
</p>

<p>
"Point Two: he tells a very fishy sort
of tale&mdash;namely, that your father was not
lost at sea at all, but was rescued&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What?" broke in the girl, leaning forward.
Again Dennis nodded, imperturbable.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, if you care to believe it.  I don't!
He says that your father was taken into
Unalaska by some natives who had found
him on one of the Aleut islands&mdash;he was then
down with something like what used to be
called 'brain fever'.  It left him quite
paralysed.  He was taken to Vancouver and is
now in a sailors' home there.  Being paralysed,
barely able to keep alive, he has been
unable to tell his name&mdash;mind you, this is
all Boatswain Joe's narrative.
</p>

<p>
"Ericksen, or some of his friends, saw
your father there and recognized him, and
promptly took him in charge.  Do you get
that, Florence?  They have him in a house
in Vancouver now, taking care of him.
Point Two!  They are not philanthropists;
why did they do this?  Why did they not
communicate with the authorities?  Why
do they send Boatswain Joe to get you?"
</p>

<p>
"To get&mdash;me?" The girl's brown eyes
shone eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Ericksen wants you to go and
see your father, wants you to try to
communicate with him.  Why?  I don't know.
Probably your father knows something that
Ericksen or his friends want to know.  Well,
I suppose you'd go quick enough, if you
believed the story?"
</p>

<p>
"Go?" she flashed.  "Of course!  To-day&mdash;now!"
</p>

<p>
"Ericksen seemed to think you might not,"
said Dennis dryly.  "He offered me a thousand
dollars to persuade you to go.  I refused
to give him your address; we came to Chicago
together last night, and I told him you'd
meet us for dinner.  That's all.  Point Three,
why did he offer me that money?"
</p>

<p>
He was silent for a minute, then knocked
out his pipe and swung around to face her.
</p>

<p>
"Look squarely at it, Florence: there's
something mighty queer in the wind!  Point
one: why did Boatswain Joe come in person
to get you?  Point two: why are his friends
taking care of your father?  Point three:
why do they try to bribe me to persuade
you to go?  I don't like it."
</p>

<p>
She gazed at him silently, frowningly.
</p>

<p>
"I can't answer any of those questions,"
she said at last, slowly.  "But if my father
is alive, and in that condition&mdash;my place
is with him!  Let's leave it until we see
this man.  He will perhaps have some proofs
to offer me.  He would have no incentive to
tell such a story if it were not true....
About yourself, Tom: what do you intend
to do now?"
</p>

<p>
He laughed shortly.  "I've scarcely thought
about it, Florence; this other thing has been
on my mind all night.  But I know this:
I'll not let you go West in company with
that sailor!  That's dead sure.  If his story
is really true, then I'm going along, somehow!"
</p>

<p>
He glanced at his watch, and rose.  "Time!
Say nothing definite to Ericksen.  Listen
to him and form your own conclusions.
Make an appointment with him for
to-morrow to give him your answer; better
make it for the 'Royton' again.  Make him
agree to pay our expenses West."
</p>

<p>
"You know I'll not take his money, Tom&mdash;on
such an errand."
</p>

<p>
"I will, though."  And Dennis laughed.
"I'm down to thirty-four dollars!  Besides,
I want to see just how readily he'll agree
to shell out real money.  There's something
queer about that crowd's being willing to
pay so high to get you to Vancouver!"
</p>

<p>
"All sailors are generous," said the girl
softly.  "Perhaps some friends of father's
are behind it."
</p>

<p>
"They didn't telegraph you, did they?
Well, we shall see.  Anyway&mdash;draw him out!"
</p>

<p>
In silence they regained the corridors,
descended the wide staircase, and sought
the street.  Presently they entered a deserted
lobby and gained the elevator running to
the restaurant above.
</p>

<p>
When they stepped out of the car, they
found Boatswain Joe awaiting them, manifestly
ill at ease, and obviously an object
of some suspicion on the part of the restaurant
people.  Dennis, knowing the head waiter
of old, gained a quiet table in a corner and
ordered dinner.
</p>

<p>
He was covertly watching Florence, to
see how she took to the seaman; but she
was plainly doing her best to put Ericksen
at his ease.  Amid these surroundings, he
was anything but comfortable.  The linen
and silver, the table appointments, the
orchestra, the general surroundings&mdash;all
abashed and discomfited him.  Tom Dennis
grinned to himself, for this was precisely
what he had aimed at.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
But Boatswain Joe was there for a purpose
and lost no time getting about it.  Florence
Hathaway, too, was wildly eager to
authenticate the news of her father, and
urged him to tell his story at once.  So
Ericksen, by the time the soup arrived,
was into it full swing and was forgetting
his own awkwardness and the girl's presence;
bashfulness left him, and he told the story
more in detail than he had to Dennis&mdash;perhaps
under the spell of those glowing
brown eyes.
</p>

<p>
And Dennis, studying the man, realized
that Ericksen was no fool.  He had guessed
as much from the twisted lines of the face.
Now, the more he listened, the more Dennis
felt that Boatswain Joe had been well chosen
for his present errand.  The man presented
the story of Captain Hathaway with a
simplicity which carried conviction.
</p>

<p>
"So, ma'am, the skipper and the missus
are takin' care of him," he concluded.
"The skipper says to me: 'If the lady wants
proof, boatswain, you give it to her!'  So,
ma'am, I got some pictures took showin'
all of us."
</p>

<p>
Ericksen took an envelope from his pocket
and passed it to the girl.  She drew forth
some photographs&mdash;and her face went
white.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Ericksen!"  Dennis leaned
forward, his eyes gripping the gaze of the
sailor.  "There are some things we don't
understand.  Why did you come in person
to find Miss Hathaway?  Who's your skipper,
and why is he taking care of Captain
Hathaway?  Why are you spending so much
money on the project?"
</p>

<p>
The arrogant, light-blue eyes flashed
suddenly&mdash;a flash of suspicion, of anger.
</p>

<p>
"Sailormen don't count pennies," said the
man curtly.  "Besides, the skipper&mdash;Cap'n
Pontifex&mdash;he used to know Cap'n Hathaway.
Friends, they were."
</p>

<p>
"And he expects to get some information
through Miss Hathaway?"
</p>

<p>
Ericksen's freckled features reddened.  His
one satanic eyebrow twitched upward.
</p>

<p>
"Aye, that's true enough; but what it is,
ain't for me to say.  'You mind your jaw-tackle,
boatswain,' says the skipper.  That's all."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Dennis will go West with us," said
Florence Hathaway softly, extending the
pictures to Dennis.  "You will furnish
expenses, Mr. Ericksen?"
</p>

<p>
"Aye, miss."  In the light-blue eyes Dennis
read a sudden avid gleam.  They were very
dangerous, those eyes, very predatory and
unscrupulous.  "Aye, miss&mdash;here an' now."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The seaman drew from his pocket a small
roll of bills and counted off three fifties
which he extended to Dennis.  The latter
took them.  The eyes of the two men met
and held; and again Dennis felt that sense
of enmity, of forced geniality, as though
the man were concealing a deadly hostility
beneath a show of eager conciliation.  First
Boatswain Joe had desired to propitiate
him; now he desired to propitiate Florence
Hathaway.
</p>

<p>
Dennis shoved the money into his pocket,
despite a glance of entreaty from the girl.
</p>

<p>
The photographs numbered four; in each
was shown a figure in a wheel-chair&mdash;and
the figure was that of Captain Hathaway.
Dennis had seen other and older pictures of
Florence Hathaway's father, and he recognized
at once that massive countenance, that
giant frame, those wide and unafraid eyes.
He looked less at this figure, however, than
at those others showing in the pictures.
</p>

<p>
One was Captain Pontifex&mdash;a man tall
and thin, face cavernous and pallid, with
deep-sunk eyes and a curled black moustache.
Another was that of Mrs. Pontifex&mdash;"the
Missus", as Boatswain Joe termed her; her
face was indistinct, although her figure
seemed very large.  In two of the pictures
Ericksen himself showed.  The only other
figure was that of a black man, quite
indistinct, whom Ericksen described as the
skipper's mate, Manuel Mendez, a "black
Portuguese" from the Cape Verde Islands.
Tom Dennis returned the envelope to
Ericksen.
</p>

<p>
"I don't want your thousand dollars,"
he said quietly.  "I've told Miss Hathaway
all you said to me, and your offer of a bribe;
it is not necessary."
</p>

<p>
Ericksen was quite unperturbed.
</p>

<p>
"Then, miss, I take it that you'll go?"
</p>

<p>
Florence smiled at him; and when she
smiled, her frail features were suddenly
lighted as by warm sunshine.
</p>

<p>
"Meet us here for luncheon to-morrow,
Mr. Ericksen, and I'll give you my decision."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, ma'am&mdash;and if I may say so,
there's a bit o' haste."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly.  If we go, we'll be ready to
catch the limited at eight to-morrow night."
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't ask no better, miss!" exclaimed
the sailor.  "Shipshape talk; that's what it
is.  'If we go,' says you, 'we'll go on the
jump'&mdash;just like that!  Aye, all Bristol-fashion
and trim!  I'm proud to ha' met
you, Miss Hathaway, and I hope you'll be
able to get a few words out o' your poor
father."
</p>

<p>
Ericksen checked himself abruptly, as
though he had said too much.  But he did
not ask any questions concerning the money
he had given Dennis; and this, to the mind
of Dennis was an unnatural and puzzling
fact, for Ericksen would hardly have handed
over the money unless he were certain of
Florence Hathaway's decision.  The entire
attitude of this seaman was puzzling in the
extreme.  His money carelessness might be
explained by the fact that Captain Pontifex
was backing him&mdash;but it looked queer.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Something of these thoughts was troubling
Tom Dennis as he left the building with
Florence Hathaway; they had parted with
Ericksen in the restaurant lobby, seemingly
to the entire satisfaction of the seaman.
Dennis had already phoned for a taxicab,
and as they went bowling up toward the
North Shore, the girl noticed his silence.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Tom?  A penny for your thoughts!"
</p>

<p>
"I was wondering what Ericksen's game
can be&mdash;and who that Cap'n Pontifex is!"
</p>

<p>
"I never heard of him.  Certainly father
never mentioned him.  Well, you're going
to keep that money?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  It's fair loot from the enemy."
</p>

<p>
"Enemy?  But, Tom&mdash;surely you don't
think Ericksen and his friends&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I'm convinced that there's something
back of it all, Florence, something we don't
know about!  And that it's nothing very good."
</p>

<p>
The girl laughed.  "Oh, Tom, you're
delicious!  Well, suit yourself; we'll go
West to-morrow night&mdash;that is, I'm going.
You can only go on one condition."
</p>

<p>
"Yes?"  He looked at her, suspicious of
the twinkle in her eyes.  "What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Tell you in a minute, dear.  Now, it's
true that you've failed in Marshville?"
</p>

<p>
"Absolutely and utterly."
</p>

<p>
"And you don't know what you're going to do?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"It would be very foolish for us to marry,
wouldn't it&mdash;especially with poor father to
be taken care of?  I have eight hundred
dollars in the bank&mdash;a little surprise for
you dear; but we shall probably have to
stay West and get a fresh start.  And, Tom,
it'll take a long time before we get on our
feet, won't it?"
</p>

<p>
He stared gloomily at the taxicab window,
bitterly conscious that she spoke the truth.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," he assented.  "I had no
intention of coming to you, a failure, and
holding you to your promise, Florence."  His
voice was harsh.  "I doubt if I would
have come, only that this other affair brought
me.  You're quite right.  It would be criminal
for us to marry, with only a few dollars in
the world, and your helpless father&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hush!"  Her hand fluttered over his
lips, and he promptly kissed it.  "Don't
say that it would be criminal, Tom; it
would only be foolish."
</p>

<p>
"What's the condition?" he insisted.
</p>

<p>
"I'm coming to that.  You admit, then,
that in our present circumstances we should
play the safe game, wait until we get
established in the West, and until we get on
our feet financially?"
</p>

<p>
"We ought to, of course," he nodded,
storm in his eyes.  "It would be folly to
face poverty, to assume everything&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it very foolish to be in love at all,
Tom, dear?"
</p>

<p>
"Not with you!  That's something nobody
could help."
</p>

<p>
"Then this is my condition; and if you
refuse, you can't go West!  To-morrow
morning we shall be married.  We shall
deliberately be foolish&mdash;assume our burdens,
have each other and make the best of things!
Oh, don't stare at me.  Don't you think
my love and confidence and faith in you
are supreme, dear?  They are.  We'll only
win by daring&mdash;so we shall dare everything!
And with each other, Tom&mdash;we
shall win!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br /><br />
LAYING A COURSE
</h3>

<p>
When the dinner was over, Boatswain
Joe was in no haste to leave the restaurant;
but he returned to the table and ordered a
drink, having seen Dennis and Florence
Hathaway depart.  As he had already paid
for the meal, giving the waiter a handsome
<i>pourboire</i>, no objection was made to his
remaining as long as he wished.  He stated
that he expected a telephone-call.
</p>

<p>
Nearly an hour later, indeed, the waiter
summoned him to the lobby.  Ericksen took
up the telephone-receiver and said: "Aye,
matey!"  Then he listened.  Again he said:
"Aye, matey!" and hung up the receiver.
</p>

<p>
He took the elevator to the street and
briskly walked the two and a half blocks
to a down-town hotel.  It appeared that
he was stopping here, for he went directly
to the desk, demanded his key, then vanished
in the elevator.
</p>

<p>
Fifteen minutes later a man inquired at
the desk for Mr. Ericksen, and was shown
to the room occupied by Boatswain Joe.
This second man was as peculiar in
appearance as the red-haired boatswain.  He
was rather small, very dapper in looks, and
wore a tight little moustache on his upper
lip.  His movements were swift, agile,
extremely alert.  One would have said that
he was a Frenchman, although upon entering
Ericksen's room he spoke in good English.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Boatswain!  Well done, my friend;
you described them excellently."
</p>

<p>
Ericksen regarded him with a twisted smile.
</p>

<p>
"Then you followed them?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly.  They went to a place on the
North Side, a girls' school where she teaches;
presently he came out and walked to a
lodging-house on North Clark Street.  I
followed him inside and engaged a room
adjoining his, which I shall occupy this
afternoon.  He is on the third <i>étage</i>&mdash;what
you call&mdash;yes, flight!  Upstairs."
</p>

<p>
"Good, Dumont."  Ericksen ran his fingers
through his tousled red hair.  "We've made
quick work of it, eh?  Got here two days
ago, and ready to slip our cable to-morrow
night.  'Move sharp,,' says the Skipper;
'crack on all sail!'  And we've done it.
Hey?  You've got your stuff all complete?"
</p>

<p>
Dumont lighted a cigarette and blew a
thin cloud, nodding.
</p>

<p>
"All done.  Everything is to be ready for
me to-morrow morning.  I shall inspect it;
then it will be packed in a special suitcase,
ready for the shipment."
</p>

<p>
"Good.  We're leaving to-morrow night
at eight bells or thereabouts.  Get your
ticket in the morning, and check the stuff on
it.  Sure it's what the Skipper ordered?"
</p>

<p>
Dumont inspected him with a sleepy
cattish smile.
</p>

<p>
"Me, my friend, I make no mistakes.  Ah,
that skipper of ours!  He is a marvel, a great
man!  It is not every man who can improve
upon the so-wonderful Dumas!  But this
our skipper, he does so&mdash;pouf!  Like that.
To him&mdash;it is nothing at all."
</p>

<p>
"I dunno about that there Dumaw," returned
Ericksen.  "I used to know a guy o'
that name, a nigger mate on the <i>Columbia</i>
packet out o' Singapore&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Dumont chuckled.  "Worry not your so
red head, my friend!  Now, suppose you
have the goodness to explain?  Who is this
man with the big body and the dangerous
eyes?"
</p>

<p>
"Dangerous, rats!" Ericksen snorted.  "On
his uppers, he is.  Ran foul o' law-sharks
an' got laid on his beam-ends.  He's
suspicious; that's all.  He and the lady are
goin' to get spliced, see?  Or they think
they are.  His name's Dennis.  He means to
go West with us."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The sleepy eyes of Dumont suddenly
opened.  They became very black and
flashing.  His white teeth showed beneath
his tiny moustache in a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I see!  It is in that direction the
land lies!  Well, let him come.  Let our
so-wonderful skipper take care of him!"
</p>

<p>
Ericksen shook his head.  "Nope.  Skipper
says: 'Boatswain, don't you bring no
barnacles along!  Bring that young lady&mdash;and
no barnacles.'  Skipper knowed what he was
about; strike me blind if he didn't!  So
Mr. Dennis he stays here."
</p>

<p>
Dumont regarded his companion with an
admiring air.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, you have the head, my friend!  You
have not the looks, perhaps, but the
head&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter with my looks,
Frenchy?" demanded Ericksen suddenly,
regarding the smaller man with steady eyes.
"Come, now!  Step aft an' speak it out,
you!  What's the matter with 'em?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing in particular&mdash;merely the general
aspect."  And Dumont cocked his head on
one side in pretended survey.  Then he broke
into laughter.  "<i>Drôle</i>!  You cannot afford
to fight with me, eh?  No.  And you know
better.  Eh?  I have always desired, my
friend, to get my finger in that left eye of
yours; it looks so devilish!  I always
wondered how the socket would look&mdash;if there
were not a little devil sitting there,
<i>couchant</i>!"
</p>

<p>
Ericksen changed countenance suddenly,
and sat back in his seat.  Behind those
jesting words of Dumont's there lay a
grotesque speculation&mdash;an earnestness, even!
The dapper little man assumed a frightful
air, an air of abnormality.  One sensed that
he spoke of tearing out a man's eye with
calm enjoyment, as though&mdash;as though he
had done it before this.
</p>

<p>
"You're right, hearty," said Ericksen,
wetting his lips.  "Right-o!  No trouble in
the after cabin, and there'll be none forward.
What were we speakin' of?  Oh, yes!  Dennis.
Well, you go and occupy that room to-night,
and do your business to-morrow morning,
then go back there.  Dennis will mess with
me an' the lady to-morrow noon, see?  You
get me a scrap of his fist&mdash;or better, take a
squint at it and copy this here entry in the
log."
</p>

<p>
Ericksen took from the table a paper
bearing a few lines of writing, on which he
had been engaged when Dumont entered, and
passed it to his friend.  The latter scrutinised
the writing, and chuckled softly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  For the lady, eh?  Ah, what a
head you have!  It is wasted upon you, my
friend.  It should have gone with such
intelligence as mine."
</p>

<p>
"You lay off them personal remarks,
Frenchy," snapped Ericksen suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"Aye, matey," retorted the other with
mocking air.  "Well?  What next?"
</p>

<p>
"You telephone me here right after noon
mess.  I'll be able to give you Dennis'
afternoon programme then.  You've got to stop
him from taking that train to-morrow
night&mdash;an' stop him hard!  Don't forget to take
all his money, either&mdash;strip him to the bone."
</p>

<p>
Dumont shrugged.  "What would you?
Here in Chicago are the police, and I like
them not.  It is not as if we were aboard the
<i>Pelican</i>, my friend."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't kill him," snapped Ericksen
impatiently.  "Merely a good stiff jolt that
will leave him on his back a few days.  And
do it at the last minute, too.  'Take no
chances, Boatswain,' says the Skipper, 'and
if there's any wind in sight, get your
top-canvas down.'  So do it at the last minute,
and then get the train.  Have a taxi waiting."
</p>

<p>
"All right."  Dumont straightened up.
"Let's go see a picture-show, eh?"
</p>

<p>
Ericksen assented with a grunt.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Promptly at one o'clock on Monday,
Boatswain Joe was waiting in the lobby of
the Royton restaurant, when Tom Dennis
and Florence were deposited by the elevator.
With a cheerful grin on his freckled features,
Ericksen approached them.
</p>

<p>
"Good day to you.  'Two bells,' says you,
and two bells it is, all shipshape!  It's fine
and rosy ye look, ma'am!"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Mr. Ericksen."  And under
his light-blue predatory eyes the girl blushed
as she shook hands.  "I've been shopping
this morning, and that always makes a
woman happy, you know!"
</p>

<p>
They entered the breakfast-room, where
the waiter, mindful of Ericksen's tip, led
them to a table by one of the front windows
overlooking the Art Institute and the
sparkling blue lake front.
</p>

<p>
"Does it remind you of the sea?"  Tom
Dennis motioned toward the blue horizon,
and smiled at the sailor.
</p>

<p>
"In a way, yes.  It looks like the sea down
south, under the Line."
</p>

<p>
"You've been in the South Seas?" asked
the girl quickly.  Ericksen met her gaze, and
seemed a trifle embarrassed.
</p>

<p>
"Yes'm, oncet or twicet.  I been whalin'
with Cap'n Pontifex, you know, all us
whalers work off Lower California and across
to the islands 'fore going north&mdash;that is, we
used to.  Nowadays things change.  'There's
no tellin' at all,' says the Skipper, 'what
kind of a wind is rising these days.'  And
Skipper's right."
</p>

<p>
"You seem to like your skipper."  Florence
laughed.  "Is he a nice man?"
</p>

<p>
Ericksen's down-drawn left lip twitched
as if in repression of a grimace.
</p>

<p>
"Nice is as nice does, hey?  I reckon he's
all right, Miss Hathaway."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you mustn't call me that any more,"
said the girl calmly, and held out her hand.
"Look at the present I got an hour ago!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Ericksen's predatory eyes fastened upon
the gold circlet.  His face whitened.  Tom
Dennis, watching intently, saw the man's
lips open and form a silent unspoken curse.
In the light-blue eyes he read a message of
astounded incredulity, of passionate anger.
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;you've been an' got spliced!"
Ericksen, speaking hoarsely, looked at
Florence.  His face changed suddenly.  He
plunged to his feet and extended a horny
hand across the table toward Dennis.
</p>

<p>
"Strike me blind!" he ejaculated.  "Took
me all of a heap, it did!  Well, sir, this is a
surprise!  And only an hour ago, you say?
Congratulations, and may you always have
a fair course and a bone in your teeth; aye,
and a good cargo under hatches!  Well,
well&mdash;strike me blind if I'd thought this was
goin' to happen!  We'll have a bottle o'
fizz-wine, hey?  A toast all around&mdash;real
weddin' dinner!  And to think o' me sittin'
here with no present, nothin' but an honest
sailor-man's hearty good wishes to give&mdash;why,
it fair breaks me up!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we decided to make the trip West
our honeymoon," said Tom Dennis, with a
smile at Florence.  "It was too good a chance
to miss, Boatswain."
</p>

<p>
"Then&mdash;then you're going, hey?  To-night?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Mr. Ericksen."  Florence nodded.
"And believe me, I'd sooner have your good
wishes than all the presents in the world!
Good wishes mean lots more, don't they?"
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes, miss.  Ha&mdash;I mean,
Mrs. Dennis&mdash;sometimes," assented Ericksen
solemnly.  "And to think o' you springing
it on me that way&mdash;why, it took me all
aback, it did!"
</p>

<p>
So the "fizz-wine" came and was drunk
with many toasts.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In the course of the luncheon it developed
that Florence was to spend the afternoon
packing for the trip, and would dine at the
school in order to save time.  Tom Dennis,
who had in view an endeavour to secure
orders for some special articles on the West
from his former newspaper editors, arranged
to call for her in time to make the train that
night.
</p>

<p>
Ericksen insisted upon protracting the
luncheon with a second bottle of "fizz-wine"
in honour of the occasion; afterward
all three departed, and separated at the
Adams Street entrance to the "L", where
the newly-married couple said farewell to
Boatswain Joe.
</p>

<p>
No sooner had they vanished up the stairway
than Boatswain Joe made all haste to
his hotel.  He found no message at the desk;
but when he entered his room he found
Dumont awaiting him.
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;here!  What's up, Frenchy?"
</p>

<p>
Smilingly, Dumont extended him a note
Ericksen seized it and examined it with
quick approval.
</p>

<p>
"It was very easily done, my friend,"
said Dumont, yawning sleepily.  "So I came
here myself.  You seem to be irritated, eh?
What is the matter?"
</p>

<p>
Ericksen gave vent to a full-blown curse.
</p>

<p>
"Matter enough!  Here that swab has been
and married her this mornin'!"
</p>

<p>
Dumont's brows lifted.  He uttered a long
whistle.
</p>

<p>
"They are married!  Well, Cap'n Pontifex,
he will not like that, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Blast it!" snarled Ericksen.  "Don't you
see what it means?"
</p>

<p>
"More or less," Dumont spat out the words
with venom.  "It means that the Skipper
promised me the girl, eh?  And that now he
will try&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You bloody fool!" roared Ericksen,
smashing his big fist down on the table.
"Don't it mean squalls ahead of us all?
Don't it mean that instead of havin' her to
deal with, now we have him too?  Don't it
mean that he's signed up for a share in old
Hathaway's leavin's?  And if we don't
scuttle him, then he'll scuttle us!"
</p>

<p>
Dumont caressed his moustache, his dark
yes narrowed and alert.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mille tonnerre</i>!" he ejaculated slowly.
"You are right.  He is the old man's
son-in-law, eh?  Ah, but you have the head, my
friend!  You see the things, yes!  And her
signature would be no good, eh?"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Ericksen rammed tobacco into his pipe and
held his peace for a moment, until the briar
was smoking.
</p>

<p>
"Now," he said shortly, "that train leaves
to-night at one bell?"
</p>

<p>
"Eight and the half," assented Dumont
with a nod.
</p>

<p>
"He's goin' to call for her about eight
bells, see?  He'll prob'ly be in his room
stowin' his dunnage bag about six bells.
You have to scuttle him, Frenchy&mdash;all
proper.  Open the sea-cocks and stand by
the ship till she's gone.  No mistake!"
</p>

<p>
"And the madame?" queried Dumont.
"Who will call for her?"
</p>

<p>
"I will.  And this here note you've
written&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, now I understand!"  Dumont
chuckled softly.  "You have the head, my
friend!  Good.  I must scuttle this fellow,
eh?  Well, it is for all our sakes now.  And
by the way, I have taken a compartment, so
that I could keep my eye on the suitcase
better.  The Skipper said to be careful.  I
had to buy another ticket."
</p>

<p>
Ericksen merely waved his hand carelessly.
"You scuttle that swab, Frenchy, and money
won't cut no figure.  So you'll carry the
suitcase, eh?  Better send it down to the
train ahead of you.  'Don't get your lines
tangled,' says the Skipper.  You mind that!
I'll sleep with you in the compartment, eh?
All right."
</p>

<p>
"All right," assented the other.  "I'll
send the suitcase down to the train.  Now
see, my friend!  Is it not humorous&mdash;what
you call the paradox?  In order to make our
little venture legal, we must first keel a
man!  Is it not droll!"
</p>

<p>
Boatswain Joe thrust forward his head,
and so terribly threatening were his arrogant
light-blue eyes that Dumont flinched a
trifle.
</p>

<p>
"Never you mind your laughin'&mdash;it ain't
time yet, Frenchy!  You mind your course,
d'ye see?  Fall off a couple o' points and
things'll be in a mess, see?  You mind your
course!  You and me have big lays in this
thing.  If it goes through all shipshape, we'll
have money.  Now, you let her head fall off
and there'll be trouble, see?"
</p>

<p>
Dumont spread out his hands, Gallic fashion.
</p>

<p>
"My friend," he said softly, "there is no
need for threats.  Me, I know what to do.
Me, I shall do it, so!  But remember one
thing, you: on the train, you shall introduce
me to the lady, so I shall console her
for the absent one.  Eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Agreed!"  Ericksen made an impatient
gesture.  "You're a dago and you can't help
settin' your course by a woman, I s'pose.
But you better watch out, Frenchy.  This
here one is married."
</p>

<p>
Dumont smiled.  "I shall attend to
that&mdash;to-night."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br /><br />
THE SQUARE SUITCASE
</h3>

<p>
Tom Dennis, in the meantime, was making
some discoveries.
</p>

<p>
In the course of the afternoon he dropped
in at his old newspaper office with the
object of seeing the boys and trying to get
some special assignments on the Pacific
Coast.  In this latter endeavour he was more
successful than he had dared hope, for the
editor declared at once in favour of a series
of articles on the Canadian training-camps
in the vicinity of Vancouver, and even spoke
of syndicating them.
</p>

<p>
Thus, when Dennis returned to the city-room,
he was in hopeful vein.  Most of his
old friends were still on the staff, with some
new men; he said nothing about his marriage,
or about his failure in Marshville, but
stated that he had been called to the Pacific
Coast on unexpected business, and let it go
at that.
</p>

<p>
Then Margate entered, and gripped his
hand with a shout.  Margate was the "big
man", who covered political conventions
and topics of country-wide interest.  It
appeared that Margate had himself just
returned from the Coast where he had been
doing some big things with the moving-picture
stars.  Dennis retired into a corner
with him, and in the course of their chat
casually inquired:
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you never heard of a sea-captain
out there by the name of Pontifex,
did you?  It's an odd sort of moniker&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Margate grinned.
</p>

<p>
"Heard of him?  I should say yes!  He's
the only chap I ever heard of who put it all
over the motion-picture people.  Why,
they're yelling about it yet!"
</p>

<p>
"How's that?" asked Dennis in unaffected
surprise.
</p>

<p>
"It seems this chap Pontifex owned an old
whaling brig.  She was laid up at San Pedro,
in pretty bad shape, and the Greatorex
people wanted to use her in a couple of
scenarios.  So Pontifex leased her to
them&mdash;savvy?  About six months ago they got
through with her&mdash;and then they discovered
something.  In his lease, Pontifex had slipped
over a couple of jokers; they had to refit
the old hooker from top to bottom and make
her ready for sea.  I forget how many
thousands it cost them.  I remember she was sent
up to him at Vancouver, just before I came
East, and everyone was slipping the laugh
to the Greatorex folks at the way a whaling
skipper had put it over them.  And believe
me, the job was done right!  It takes a
genius to manage a stunt like that nowadays."
</p>

<p>
"Then you don't know Pontifex personally?"
</p>

<p>
"Lord, no!  What are you running down,
anyhow?  Is he a pirate?"
</p>

<p>
Dennis laughed.  "I hope not.  I've heard
some things about him, though&mdash;good
human-interest stuff for a magazine feature, if
they're true.  I'll look him up at Vancouver.
What's the name of his ship?"
</p>

<p>
"The <i>Pelican</i>.  Say, if you're there any
time, look up my brother; he's doing
shipping stuff on <i>The Vancouver Mail</i>.  He'll
be glad to do the honours, and you might
pick up some good dope from him."
</p>

<p>
When he left the office, Dennis sought the
railroad office and bought tickets for himself
and Florence to Vancouver, obtaining a
compartment; the money which Ericksen
had given him, with what he had left of his
own, proved quite sufficient.  Then,
encountering Margate and a couple more men
from the office, he went to dinner with them.
At seven o'clock he was on the way home to
pack.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It had not been a highly romantic wedding-day,
he reflected, either for himself or for
Florence; but they would have a trip of
four days in which to make up for that.  The
commissions for work at Vancouver were a
tremendous aid to Dennis, keeping him from
feeling that he was loafing on the job.  The
money, too, would help.  And he anticipated
no particular difficulty in getting work.  He
was one of the well-known men in his profession,
and a place would be made for him;
he was not a newspaper "tramp".  He was
not one of the shiftless or incompetent
men-of-all-trades who seek the Coast as a haven
of refuge.  Already, in view of his unexpected
marriage and the all-impelling faith of
Florence, he had risen above the despondency
induced by his Marshville venture.
</p>

<p>
He had obtained no information from
Florence which could serve to throw any
light upon Ericksen or Captain Pontifex;
she had been entirely ignorant of what
knowledge they wished to extract from her
or from her paralysed father.  Captain
Hathaway's last ship, a freighter named the
<i>John Simpson</i>, had been lost while <i>en route</i>
from San Francisco to Vladivostok.  She had
gone down with all hands somewhere off the
Aleuts, and with Captain Hathaway totally
paralysed since his rescue it was unlikely
that her story would ever be known.
</p>

<p>
As Tom Dennis packed together his few
belongings, with purchases which he had
made that day, he blessed the girl who had
that morning married him, and he swore
savagely to himself that it would not be for
worse, but for better.  Not easily had he
assented to her proposal; not easily had he
grasped her reasons for making it; but now
he realized the sheer truth which she had
seen from the first.  There was no danger
whatever that he would be unable to provide
the necessities of life.  True, heart-trouble,
of which he had never before been aware,
had barred him from wearing a uniform;
but this disease was a remote danger.  His
ability lay in his head, and he had no doubt
about his ability to win a fair living wage.
The paralytic Captain Hathaway would be
in some ways a burden, but one which Tom
Dennis cheerfully assumed.
</p>

<p>
"With faith in the future and in each
other, we would have been fools not to
marry!" he confided to his suitcase.  "We'll
pull through; and we'll make a tenfold
better fight for having each other!  I'm
almost glad that the old <i>Clarion</i> went
under&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He did not hear his door open; nor did
he hear the approach of a swift catlike form
from the doorway.  He did, however, feel
the draught from the open door.  He half-turned;
but he turned only to feel a crashing
blow on the head.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Dumont stood over the prostrate figure,
softly chuckling, and stowed away the
blackjack which had dealt the blow.  The figure
of Dennis lay motionless, arms outflung;
his profile was visible against the rug, and
the eyes were closed.  His assailant eyed
him for a moment, then stepped to the
window and drew down the blind.  A single
electric bulb lighted the room.
</p>

<p>
Dumont returned to his victim.  From his
pocket he produced a handkerchief folded
and padded with cotton.  From another
pocket he took a thin flat vial of chloroform
which he poured heavily over the handkerchief;
the fumes sickened the air.  Then he
knelt, and put a hand half under Dennis,
feeling the heart.
</p>

<p>
"Good!" he muttered with an air of pride.
He spoke in French, his voice low.  "It was
a good job.  The bump on his head will not
be observed.  They will think it suicide."
</p>

<p>
And then sudden wild surprise and
consternation convulsed his features.  His left
hand, beneath Dennis, was suddenly seized
and twisted by iron fingers.  Dumont, a
startled oath on his lips, was pulled forward
off his balance and fell headlong over his
victim.  Both bodies heaved madly.
</p>

<p>
Across the would-be assassin the big figure
of Tom Dennis sprawled heavily.  Dumont
had been entirely taken by surprise.  Dennis
seized the handkerchief and clapped it over
the face of his opponent.
</p>

<p>
The Frenchman fought.  He struggled
viciously, silently, desperately; he struck
with fists and nails and knees, biting at the
hand which held the bandage across his
mouth and nose.
</p>

<p>
"No use, my friend," said Dennis, speaking
half-forgotten French.  "You didn't hit
quite hard enough."
</p>

<p>
The convulsive struggles of Dumont, held
helpless by sheer weight, quieted into jerky
movements.  Tom Dennis knocked away the
saturated handkerchief and turned the limp
figure on its face.  He shook out the
handkerchief and knotted the wet linen about the
wrists of Dumont.  Then, weakly, he caught
at a chair and pulled himself erect.
</p>

<p>
Dennis felt deathly sick.  That clip over
the ear had been a shrewd one, and in the
closed room the fumes of the narcotic reeked
from the bottle which had spilled its entire
contents on the floor.  Dizzy and staggering,
he groped his way to the window and flung
it open.  He knelt there, his head on the
window-sill, bathing himself in the fresh air.
</p>

<p>
"A near thing!" he muttered.  "A near thing!"
</p>

<p>
How long he lay there he did not know.
The sickness, the nausea, passed from him
by slow degrees.  He gingerly felt his head,
finding that the skin was unbroken; a lump
had already risen.  His senses were still
aswim when at length he rose to his feet.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The Frenchman was senseless, but was
probably in no danger.  Inspecting the man,
Dennis remembered to have seen him entering
the adjoining room that same evening.  But
what could have been the motive of this
amazing assault by an utter stranger, a
fellow lodger with whom he had never
exchanged a word?  It did not appear to be
robbery, for Dumont was well-dressed.  The
rugged features of Tom Dennis grew hard
and harsh as he gazed down, remembering
the man's words.  The chloroform had not
been intended merely to knock him out; it
had been intended to kill him!  Why?
</p>

<p>
Stooping, he ran swiftly through the
contents of Dumont's pockets.  He found an
automatic, the bluejack which had struck
him and a thin keen knife.  He found a wad
of yellow-backed bills, which he stuck into
his own pocket with a chuckle.  He found no
letters, nothing else at all&mdash;except an
envelope such as is issued at railroad ticket
offices.  In this envelope were two tickets&mdash;one
the return half of a Vancouver-to-Chicago
ticket, the other a one-way ticket from
Chicago to Vancouver; and with them was
the Pullman ticket calling for a compartment.
The date was of this very day, the train that
upon which Dennis himself was leaving!  In
the envelope, also, were two small brass
keys.
</p>

<p>
Dropping into a chair, Tom Dennis frowned
over these clues.  Could the man have some
connection with Ericksen&mdash;coming as he had
from Vancouver, and being about to return
there?  Perhaps.  Dennis suspected Ericksen,
had suspected him from the first.  But there
was no obvious connection; there was no
link of direct accusation.  Had Ericksen been
behind this assault?
</p>

<p>
Manifestly this assassin had two tickets so
that he could occupy a compartment alone.
Why?  For what purpose?  At this thought
Dennis went to his door, passed into the hall
and went directly to the next door&mdash;that of
Dumont's room.  He found the room quite
empty.  Upon the bed was a small valise,
but it contained nothing except linen and
articles of travel.
</p>

<p>
"Blamed if I can account for it!" muttered
Dennis, returning to his own room.  "This
fellow meant to bury me; that's certain.  I'll
keep his money as fair loot.  About his two
tickets and&mdash;hm!  I'd better keep them too,
and occupy that compartment occasionally.
There may be something in it which will
give me a clue.  I'll do it."
</p>

<p>
He glanced at his watch, suddenly
conscious that time had been passing.  He
was aghast to find that it was eight
o'clock&mdash;and the train left at eight-thirty!
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
With a hasty ejaculation he caught up
his suitcase, crammed it shut and after a
last glance at the recumbent assassin turned
out the light and ran downstairs to the hall
telephone.  He was too late to call for
Florence now; she must catch a taxi to the
station!
</p>

<p>
His first thought was to order a taxicab
for himself; then he called up the school
where Florence had been teaching.  There
ensued five minutes&mdash;a frantic five
minutes&mdash;of delay before a cool woman's voice
informed him that Miss Hathaway had
departed some time before; a gentleman had
called for her.
</p>

<p>
Dennis demanded a description of the
man, and recognized Ericksen.
</p>

<p>
When the taxi appeared, Dennis flung
himself into the cab and thrust a bill at the
driver with orders to make the station
regardless of traffic officers.  He saw quite
clearly, now, that Ericksen had planned this
attempted murder; there was no proof of it,
but he needed none.  What was the reason
behind it?  This question maddened Dennis.
Was Florence being abducted?  Such a thing
seemed impossible and incredible, outside
a movie scenario.
</p>

<p>
When Dennis reached the station he had
about three minutes left.  He took the gate
at a rush, showing his tickets hurriedly, and
swung aboard the nearest open vestibule of
the train just as the porters were picking up
their stools.
</p>

<p>
He found that the compartment-car was
up ahead.  Since he had his own tickets,
with that of Florence, she would certainly
not be in their compartment, but probably
in one of the Pullmans.  So he started through
the train, scrutinising each seat as he came
to it.
</p>

<p>
Two cars ahead, he came suddenly upon
Florence, who was alone.  She sprang up
with a glad cry, and Dennis saw that she
had been weeping.
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;I knew you'd make it, after all,
Tom!" she broke out, her hands going to his.
</p>

<p>
Dennis stooped and touched her lips with his.
</p>

<p>
"All right now, old girl," he said, not
bothering for an explanation of her words.
"Where's Ericksen?"
</p>

<p>
"He just went forward to arrange about
our tickets, he said."
</p>

<p>
Dennis beckoned to the porter who was
approaching.  He gave the darky the number
of his own compartment and ordered
Florence's grips taken there; then he turned
to his wife.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Mrs. Dennis," he said, chuckling
as she flushed at the name, "you go to that
compartment and wait until I show up, will
you please?  I have a little business with
Mr. Ericksen&mdash;and it won't wait a minute!"
</p>

<p>
"Is anything wrong?  Your note&mdash;it said
that you might make the train&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Dennis took from her hand a folded note
and glanced at it.  Then he thrust it into
his pocket and patted her shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"I'll be along presently, dear.  No,
nothing wrong!  I have some good news for
you, too&mdash;got some assignments out West.
I'll meet you in a few minutes."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Leaving his grip and a coin with the porter,
Tom Dennis rushed forward.  When he gained
the compartment-car, he consulted Dumont's
tickets and found that the latter had engaged
Compartment Six.  Dennis went directly to
this compartment and knocked.  The voice
of Ericksen bade him enter.  He threw open
the door and stepped inside the little room.
</p>

<p>
"Well!" Dennis closed the door behind
him and stood, smiling.  "Expecting your
friend, are you?  He's not coming, Boatswain Joe."
</p>

<p>
There was no doubt about it; Ericksen
was hard hit.  He stared at Dennis, his
mouth agape, his light-blue eyes wide-set.
</p>

<p>
"Strike me blind," he affirmed, huskily,
"if it ain't you!"
</p>

<p>
"You win.  What are you doing in this
compartment?"
</p>

<p>
"Who&mdash;me?  Why, matey, I was lookin'
for the skipper of this here train, and I pops
in here for a bit of a smoke, out of the way
and quiet!  And where might you have come
from, matey?  I thought you weren't coming
along, this cruise."
</p>

<p>
"What made you think that?" demanded Dennis.
</p>

<p>
"Why, strike me blind!" stated Ericksen
with energy.  "Didn't that there swab give
me your note sayin' you wouldn't show up?"
</p>

<p>
Tom Dennis was staggered by this defence.
</p>

<p>
"What note are you talking about?  The
one you gave Mrs. Dennis?"
</p>

<p>
"Aye, that and t'other one!  Give 'em to
me, he did, and said you wouldn't show up.
The note said the same thing, and asked me
to call for Mrs. Dennis, see?  Well, I done
it&mdash;and this here is the thanks I get!"
</p>

<p>
"What kind of a man gave you the notes?"
</p>

<p>
Ericksen was sweating profusely.  At this
question he screwed up his eyes and bit on
his pipe-stem in thought.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he answered at length, "a sort o'
rakish craft, he was, with little what-d'ye-call-'ems
of moustaches, and looked like a
dago."
</p>

<p>
That answered to the description of the
assassin, and Dennis hesitated under the
impact of a sudden thought.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
What if that Frenchman had not been an
accomplice of Ericksen at all&mdash;but an enemy,
with some ulterior purpose at work behind
his actions?  There was as much in favour of
this theory as of the other.
</p>

<p>
"See here, Ericksen!"  Dennis met the
light-blue gaze with a frowning level
scrutiny.  "If your story's true, that same
man who gave you the fake message&mdash;for it
was a fake&mdash;tried to murder me about an
hour ago.  He had a ticket to this compartment,
and a return-trip ticket from here to
Vancouver in his pocket.  Do you know him?"
</p>

<p>
"Know him?  Not me!" asserted Boatswain
Joe virtuously.  "Did you give him to
the police?"
</p>

<p>
Dennis laughed grimly.  "Worse than
that.  Well, do you know of anyone who
might have followed you from Vancouver
here?  Have you any enemies?"
</p>

<p>
From Ericksen broke a sudden exclamation.
"Strike me blind!  If you ain't hit it right
on the head, you have!  Somebody has
smoked out the Skipper's game; that's what!"
</p>

<p>
"And what's the game?" snapped Dennis.
At this the sailor wagged his head.
</p>

<p>
"Can't tell that.  'Mind your jaw-tackle,
Boatswain,' says the Skipper.  It's got to
do with Miss Hathaway&mdash;I mean Mrs. Dennis&mdash;and
her father.  It ain't for me to say.
But there's money in it, and somebody's
smoked it out&mdash;strike me blind if they
ain't!"
</p>

<p>
"Then why should that fellow have tackled
me, instead of you?"
</p>

<p>
Again Ericksen wagged his head.  "Can't
tell you that!  Didn't you make the blighter
talk?"
</p>

<p>
"He was in no condition to talk when I
got through with him," returned Dennis, and
the sailor sighed&mdash;perhaps with relief.
</p>

<p>
Glancing about, Dennis saw only one
article of luggage in the compartment&mdash;a
small square suitcase, obviously new, and
very well made.  It lacked any mark of
identification.  Beyond doubt it belonged to
the assassin.
</p>

<p>
"That was here when you dropped in for
a smoke?" demanded Dennis, pointing at it.
</p>

<p>
Ericksen surveyed the square suitcase
with surprise.  "Must ha' been!"
</p>

<p>
From his pocket Tom Dennis produced the
two small keys which the assassin had carried.
He fitted one of them to the lock of the
square suitcase; it worked.  Meantime,
Ericksen was watching him with ill-concealed
anxiety.
</p>

<p>
Throwing back the lid of the square suitcase
Dennis saw that it contained nothing
except a small phonograph and half a dozen
very large records.  The labels on the records
proclaimed them to be grand-opera selections.
Frowning thoughtfully, Dennis closed
and locked the suitcase.
</p>

<p>
"I'll take this along.  You might as well
keep this compartment, Ericksen&mdash;I took
that scoundrel's tickets; here they are.
You'll find this place more comfortable than
a berth.  And you needn't mention to
Mrs. Dennis what's happened.  It might only
worry her.  I fancy we've given your friends
the slip entirely, eh?  Sorry I suspected you
at first."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't mention it," said Ericksen,
wriggling a little.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br /><br />
THE "PELICAN"
</h3>

<p>
The brigantine-rigged <i>Pelican</i> was of but
a hundred and fifty tons burden; yet her
royal yard stood athwart the sky nearly
ninety feet above the deck.  She was not a
pretty ship, despite her snowy cleanliness,
but she was tall enough; in her 'midships
stood the brick try-works, with two funnels,
where blubber was rendered into oil; and
she reeked of the whale-juice that had soaked
her stout oaken timbers these forty years.
</p>

<p>
As she lay at anchor in Vancouver harbour,
well up toward the second narrows, there
were several peculiar features about
her&mdash;peculiar, that is, to the trained seaman's eye.
</p>

<p>
She was bound for sea; yet she was
altogether too late to get the spring catch off
the Siberian coast; and if she went up into
the Arctic to fill her hogsheads, she would
certainly be ice-bound that winter, and
few whalers were taking chances on being
ice-bound those days!  Then her crew had
been all aboard for two days, and the majority
of them were Kanakas&mdash;both facts being
unusual.  Why the <i>Pelican</i> was still hanging
about the harbour no one could say.
</p>

<p>
This old whaler had none too good a
reputation, even among her kind; but this
was chiefly because of her officers.  Manuel
Mendez, the black Cape Verde mate, was a
strapping big man with a thin eagle-like
profile exactly like that of the mummy of
Rameses&mdash;a great hooked nose, and air of
gentle refinement, and delicate lips.  Manuel
Mendez played the flute beautifully and was
said to be a killer of men.
</p>

<p>
The second officer was an old man, forty
years a whaler.  Mr. Leman wore a fringe of
white hair and whisker, stood six feet two
and was muscled like a bull moose; they
said he had been known to take a man's arm
in his two hands and break it like a rotten
stick.  His face was heavy and flat, the eyes
small and bright and deeply set.  His nose
had been crushed and had a crooked twist
</p>

<p>
One of the boat-steerers, Ericksen, was
gone from the ship.  The other, like the mate,
was a Cape Verde man; his name was a
Portuguese one, but he was called Corny.
The brigantine had no cooper, for a wonder;
her cook, like Ericksen, was absent.
</p>

<p>
The steward was a vicious little Cockney
pickpocket who wanted to get out of Canada
before the draught caught him; the cabin-boy
was a green farmer-lad named Jerry, a
moon-faced boy who had run off the farm a
month previously.  There was no one else
aft.
</p>

<p>
In the forecastle were fifteen men.  Ten of
these were Kanakas&mdash;merry brown men who
spoke their own guttural tongue and some
broken English, and like all of their kind
were noble seamen.  The other five were
broken-down white men, scum of the city,
who were kept drunk and under hatches until
the <i>Pelican</i> should get to sea.
</p>

<p>
The ship was pervaded by a restless air&mdash;that
is, in the after cabins.  Up forward the
Kanakas sang and worked light-heartedly,
and the five bums snored in drunken repose.
But aft all was different.  Restrained
excitement, an air of suspense, much whispering
and wild speculating; thus the atmosphere
seemed electrically charged.
</p>

<p>
Everyone knew that there was an invalid
down below&mdash;a man in a wheeled chair, a
man who could not speak a single word or
move a finger.  Jerry affirmed he could eat,
and could use his ears, but little more, as
his eyes also were somewhat affected.  Then,
the skipper's wife was aboard for the cruise;
and when she came to the deck, men smartened
up&mdash;not because they loved her, but
because they feared and hated her.  She was
known to all aboard as the Missus&mdash;that was
her title.
</p>

<p>
It was five in the afternoon.  Two bells had
just been struck on the brass ship's bell
abaft the mizzenmast when the Missus
appeared on the quarter-deck.  Sea-watches
had been set, and Mr. Leman had the deck,
Mrs. Pontifex was a strapping big woman
with iron-grey hair and a jaw like rock; her
unchanging expression was indomitable and
not too sweet.
</p>

<p>
"No sign of that boat, Mr. Leman?" she
demanded in a raucous voice which held a
distinct Yankee twang.
</p>

<p>
"No, ma'am," meekly responded the
second officer.  "Train must ha' been late.
Them trains often is, I'm told."
</p>

<p>
The Missus espied a Kanaka sprawled in
the waist; half-leaning against the try-works,
he was asleep in the westerning sun.
She strode to him and aroused him with a
sturdy kick in the ribs.
</p>

<p>
"Do your sleepin' daown below, ye
scouse!" she roared.  "This is no berth-deck.
Yeou, Corny!  Who went in Mr. Mendez'
boat when he took the Cap'n ashore?"
</p>

<p>
"Six of the Kanakas, ma'am," responded
the black boat-steerer.
</p>

<p>
"Hm!  Then they'll not run off.  All
ready for sea, Mr. Leman?"
</p>

<p>
"All ready, ma'am."
</p>

<p>
"The minute yeou sight that boat, break
aout the signal for the tug.  When the boat
comes alongside, yeou tell the cap'n that
we've been ordered to shift anchorage.  That'll
keep the girl and her fool husband quiet, I
reckon!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, ma'am.  And then?"
</p>

<p>
"Cast off the tug aoutside the Lion's Gate
an' lay a course for Unalaska."
</p>

<p>
"But, ma'am&mdash;how about Frenchy?  We
ain't got no cook 'cept him!"  Mr. Leman
rubbed his fringe of whiskers in evident
perturbation over putting to sea without a
cook.  "You know, ma'am, Boatswain Joe
wired about him gettin' left behind."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind 'baout Dumont."  Mrs. Pontifex's
lips set in a grim line.  "He's got
his orders, and I wired money to him.  He'll
go to Unalaska by steamer and wait there
until we put in."
</p>

<p>
"And who'll do the cookin' meantime?"
</p>

<p>
"I will.  Naow yeou get hove up on that
hawser, so's yeou can jerk up the hook in a
hurry."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Leman hastened forward, bawling
orders as he went.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Now, if there was one thing in particular
for which Tom Dennis was not in the least
prepared, it was for the reception which
awaited him at Vancouver.  He had anticipated
a seaman's cottage in the suburbs, a
protracted stay at an hotel or
boarding-house, and so forth.
</p>

<p>
Instead of this, upon alighting from the
train he found himself and Florence shaking
hands with Captain Pontifex to whom
Ericksen introduced them with much
delight.  The "Skipper" was not, to the
suspicious eye of Dennis, prepossessing in
appearance.  His curled black moustache, his
swarthy cavernous features, his alert dark
eyes, were all well enough; but the
moustache concealed a cruel and bitter mouth;
the features were high-boned and sharp;
and the eyes were of the heavy-lidded type&mdash;the
eyes of a master of men, the eyes of a
Hindenburg.
</p>

<p>
First impressions were almost effaced,
however, by the polished cordiality of
Pontifex.  He was a man of education, of intense
personality, and he was at some pains to
make himself agreeable.  Florence's first
question was for her father.
</p>

<p>
"We have taken him aboard the <i>Pelican</i>,
Mrs. Dennis; he seemed to miss the salt
air, and the lease on our cottage was up,"
responded Pontifex.  "This way, please&mdash;I
have a taxicab waiting!  I have a cabin all
ready for you aboard ship, and Mrs. Pontifex
promised to have a bang-up dinner at six
sharp; so we've just time to make the ship.
If you'll let me have your trunk-checks,
Mr. Dennis&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But Captain, we can't impose upon your
hospitality!" interrupted Tom Dennis.  "It's
mighty good of you, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense, my dear chap!"  Pontifex
laughed and seized his arm, impelling him,
toward the cab.  "It's a great pleasure, I
assure you!  Of course you young married
folks will be glad of solitude after you get
settled down with the old cap'n, but&mdash;I
suppose Ericksen told you the business we
had in hand?"
</p>

<p>
"Ericksen told us nothing," returned
Dennis.
</p>

<p>
"Good for the Boatswain!"  Pontifex
laughed again.  "I warned him to keep a
close tongue.  Well, suppose we pass up
business for to-night, and in the morning
we'll get together, eh?  The directors of the
company will be all aboard then; you'll be
our guests for a time."
</p>

<p>
"What company?" interjected Florence.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, that's the secret!"  Pontifex bowed
her into the cab, his white teeth showing in
a smile.  "A surprise for you, madam!  It
was odd, the way I happened to pick up
your father&mdash;poor man, stuck away in a
sailor's home, unable to tell so much as his
name!  You know, we were always pretty
good friends, Miles and I."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Tom Dennis found his suspicions fading,
and his first dislike of Pontifex was lulled
to rest by the man's vivid personality.
Pontifex had character, plenty of it, and like
all strong men could make himself greatly
liked or greatly hated almost at will.  He
appeared to be a good-humoured, masterly
sort of man, heartily loving a joke, and
radiating an air of alert and genial manliness.
Dennis adjudged him a good friend but a bad
enemy.
</p>

<p>
"We hope that the shock of seeing you,
Mrs. Dennis, will restore your father's power
of speech," went on Pontifex.  "For that
reason we've not told him&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But how can he be so paralysed?"
demanded Florence quickly.  "Can he hear,
and not speak?  Why&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"My dear young lady, the best doctors in
Vancouver can't account for it!"  Pontifex
shook his head with an air of paternal solicitude.
"It's one of the freak cases of paralysis;
but it's not at all an unusual case.  He can
move his eyelids slightly, his eyes perfectly; he
can eat and drink fairly well; yet his vocal
cords are entirely paralysed."
</p>

<p>
Without opportunity for further converse
they reached the water-front, and Captain
Pontifex led the way toward the landing-stage.
Tom Dennis had his own grip, a huge
affair as large as a small trunk, and two bags
belonging to Florence; of these latter the
skipper had assumed charge.
</p>

<p>
Upon reaching the boat with its six merry
Kanaka rowers, Manuel Mendez was introduced
by Pontifex.  Mendez made up for his
broken English by a wide grin, and assisted
Florence down into the stern-sheets of the
boat, beside the Skipper, who took charge of
the long steering-oar.  Dennis climbed into
the bow with Mendez.
</p>

<p>
After a short wait Ericksen appeared, a
truckman helping him bear the one trunk
which Florence had brought; this was stowed
in the boat.  Ericksen shook hands with
Mendez, flinging a laughing greeting to the
men; the Skipper, standing, flung an
impatient word at Ericksen, and the latter
turned to Dennis.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't see nothin' of that square
suitcase, Mr. Dennis&mdash;the one you took out o'
that other compartment."
</p>

<p>
Tom Dennis laughed unconcernedly.  "Oh,
that!  There was nothing in it I wanted,
Boatswain Joe; I gave it to the porter the
first night out."
</p>

<p>
Ericksen dropped his pipe to the wharf
and stooped for it, with a rumbling of low
words which did not sound like blessings.
Captain Pontifex changed countenance, then
snapped a command at the boat steerer.  His
voice was suddenly metallic, piercing.
</p>

<p>
"Hurry up, there, Boatswain!  We've no
time to dally around."
</p>

<p>
Boatswain Joe, looking very much like a
dog who is about to receive a sound thrashing,
jumped down into the boat.  The bowman
shoved off.  The oars flashed.  The
whaleboat swung out into the estuary.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Tom Dennis entertained an uneasy feeling
that he had been bodily abducted&mdash;and
laughed at himself for a simpleton.  Mendez
pointed out the <i>Pelican</i> as they approached
her, and from the other direction a tug was
crawling up to the brigantine.  As the boat
drew under the brown side of the ship, a flat
white-whiskered face appeared above the
ladder; Mendez informed Dennis that this
was the second mate, Mr. Leman.
</p>

<p>
"Ahoy, Cap'n!" called Leman in unexpectedly
stentorian tones.  "We've been
ordered to shift our anchorage, sir&mdash;port
authorities.  Tug comin' now!"
</p>

<p>
"Very well, Mr. Leman," returned Pontifex
briskly.  "Pass a line from the forward
bitts and stand ready to heave up the hook.
Mr. Mendez, will you attend to this luggage?
All ready, Miss&mdash;pardon, Mrs. Dennis!  May
I assist you up the ladder?"
</p>

<p>
If Florence entertained any shrinking from
that steep approach, she concealed it well,
and with the aid of Pontifex was soon on the
deck above being introduced to the Missus.
Tom Dennis followed.  The Missus gave him
a mighty hand-grip, then turned to Florence.
</p>

<p>
"Supper's all ready," announced
Mrs. Pontifex.  "I suppose, poor dear, yeou'd
sooner see your poor father first?  Then come
with me&mdash;do.  Cap'n, yeou make that man
Ericksen wash his face and hands before he
sits daown to table!  And put a clean shirt
on him."
</p>

<p>
Boatswain Joe was just then coming up
the side, and heard the words.
</p>

<p>
"You hear?" snapped Pontifex.
</p>

<p>
"Yes sir," he responded meekly, and his
freckled face looked rather white.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Pontifex departed with Florence,
and Tom Dennis joined them at a glance
from the latter.  All three passed down the
after companion.
</p>

<p>
In a wheeled chair set beside the stern
windows of the cabin sat Miles Hathaway.
He was not as Tom Dennis had seen him
pictured, for his rocky and indomitable
face was half-concealed by a growth of shaggy
grey beard.  His hair, too, had grown long
and was streaked with grey.  He sat motionless,
hands in lap.  His eyes, wide glowing
brown eyes like those of Florence, were
fastened upon the three who entered.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The meeting was pitiful almost to tragedy.
With a wordless cry Florence ran to her
father and knelt beside him, clasping him
in her arms, her head against his broad and
massive chest.  The man sat there unstirring,
helpless.  His eyes seemed to lack the swift
play of cheek-muscles and lids which gives
expression; yet, as those eyes dwelt upon
the upturned face of Florence, they seemed
to dilate with incredulous horror.
</p>

<p>
"We've brought your daughter, Cap'n
Hathaway," announced Mrs. Pontifex
stridently, "and her husband, Mr. Dennis."
</p>

<p>
The eyes of the helpless man turned
to Dennis and rested upon his gaze.  The
mouth of Miles Hathaway opened; he tried
terribly and frightfully to stir himself, to
break the invisible bonds which held him
tied down&mdash;and he failed.  He could not
speak or move.  Yet his eyes, fastened upon
the face of Dennis, seemed filled with some
awful and momentous message.
</p>

<p>
"I'm so glad we've found you, Father
dear!" said Florence softly, tears on her
cheeks.  "Tom and I are going to take care
of you always, and if only Mother were
here&mdash;she never knew that you were alive."
</p>

<p>
Again the mouth of Miles Hathaway opened
spasmodically, but he could not speak
His eyes were horrible to see, so dumbly
eloquent were they of the useless will of
the man.  Tom Dennis could not bear the
scene further, and touched the arm of
Mrs. Pontifex.
</p>

<p>
"Leave them&mdash;for a little while."
</p>

<p>
The woman nodded.  They left father and
daughter together.  The Missus led the way
to the mess-cabin, where they found Pontifex
opening a bottle of wine.  Up above, feet
were trampling the deck, and the brig was
heeling a trifle.
</p>

<p>
"A real dinner!" exclaimed Pontifex
heartily.  "A real wedding dinner, eh?
Mr. Leman has the deck, my dear, and he's
called all hands; so for once we'll have a
quiet family meal, eh?  Where's Mrs. Dennis?
Oh, with her father, of course.  A sad meeting
for her!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  But for you, Captain Pontifex,
there would have been none at all," said
Dennis warmly.  "We owe you a good
deal&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"There, there, don't mention it!"  Pontifex
gave his curled mustache a twirl, and his
white teeth flashed out in a smile.  "We'll
have our pay, never fear, the Missus and I.
Talk it over in the morning, eh?  I suppose
you're pretty familiar with your Dumas,
Mr. Dennis?  Well, well&mdash;a bother having
to change our anchorage this way, but the port
authorities know their business these
war-times, of course.  Well, sit down."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The dinner was excellent&mdash;although, owing
to the motion of the ship, the dishes joggled
more than a little.  Captain Pontifex made
light of it, explaining that they might not
reach their new anchorage until midnight.
</p>

<p>
With the coffee was served a liqueur,
the most peculiar and biting Tom Dennis
had ever tasted.  The skipper stated that it
was a queer distillation made from flour and
molasses by a Siberian Eskimo&mdash;quite a
rarity.  Perhaps it was this liqueur which
made Tom Dennis most unaccountably sleepy;
indeed, he could hardly stumble off to the
mate's cabin which had been assigned him
and Florence.  And as he retired, he could
faintly hear the roaring bellow of Boatswain
Joe, somewhere on deck:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "She was waiting for a fair wind to get under way,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A <i>long</i> time ago!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The last vague thought of Tom Dennis
was a mental query as to why Captain
Pontifex had asked him if he were familiar
with Dumas.  He was to remember it later,
also.

CHAPTER VI
<br /><br />
OUTWARD BOUND
</h3>

<p>
Upon the morning after the <i>Pelican</i> stood
out of the Lion's Gate and headed southward,
she was outside Cape Flattery and standing
off to the northwest, bucking and pitching
and leaning over under a stiff blow from the
westward.
</p>

<p>
Captain Pontifex, although on this cruise
he carried no third mate, adhered to the
custom of whaling skippers and stood no
watches himself except at times of necessity.
On this fine morning, however, he was on
the quarter-deck, talking with black Manuel
Mendez.  The steward approached them
gingerly, for he was rather seasick.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" snapped the skipper.  "How
are they?  Do they know we're at sea?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, they seem to, sir," returned
the Cockney.  "Mr. Dennis is wery sick, sir.
The lady, sir, is not."
</p>

<p>
"Taking care of him, is she?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Well, steward, you give them my compliments,
and say that I expect them to appear
in the saloon cabin at four bells sharp."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"And, steward!  You might ask the
Missus for a bit of raw blubber.  Eat it raw,
steward, and it'll cure what's ailing you.
fat whale blubber&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," said the steward faintly, his
cheeks turning green.  He fled in haste.
</p>

<p>
Black Mendez grinned delightedly.
"Dey'll be no good for fight, Cap'n."
</p>

<p>
The skipper merely laughed in his throat,
and strode to the companion way.  He had
changed overnight.  No longer was he under
the shadow of the land, under the hand of
port and civil and military authorities!  No
longer was he among the meshes of mankind's
net!  Here he was the master.  Here he was
authority ultimate and supreme.  Here, on
the high seas, his word, and his alone, was
law.  He only dictated; all others obeyed!
He was the skipper.  He was absolute.
</p>

<p>
Something of all this showed in his eyes
as he went below.  At the foot of the ladder
he met the Missus, rock-like and indomitable.
She looked into his eyes and shrank slightly.
</p>

<p>
"At four bells," said Captain Pontifex
curtly.  "In the cabin&mdash;with him."
</p>

<p>
She nodded and looked after him as he
swung away aft.  She was afraid of him,
but she was proud of him&mdash;was she not his
woman?  She, of whom all others aboard
the <i>Pelican</i> were in dread, stood in fear of
the skipper.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Captain Pontifex passed into the saloon
at the stern, where the helpless Miles
Hathaway sat in his chair beside the
screwed-down cot that served him as a bunk.  Despite
the hardness and the harshness and the
terror of the Missus' life, she was after all
a woman; the cabin ports were curtained
with flowered chintz, the big gun-rack and
the little bookcase were also curtained; in
the corner near the stern ports was a heavy
tea-jar lashed to the deck, in which blossomed
a huge scarlet geranium plant.  This geranium
was the pride and joy of the Missus, and
the envy and admiration of all visiting
whaling skippers.
</p>

<p>
The skipper pulled up a chair in front of
Miles Hathaway, stuffed tobacco into his
pipe, struck a match and, through the
ensuing cloud of smoke, fastened his keen
dark eyes upon the staring gaze of the
paralytic.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he observed, "I've got 'em,
haven't I?  Bit of a surprise, eh?"
</p>

<p>
It seemed as though some fearful inner
convulsion swept over the helpless man.
His mouth opened slightly; his eyelids
jerked.  But he could not speak.
</p>

<p>
Pontifex laughed.  "Told you I'd make
you talk, didn't I?  We're off to sea at last,
Cap'n, and I've got her aboard.  Also, her
husband&mdash;she'll be a widow early, won't
she?  That is, if you're still stubborn.  Well,
I told you that I expected to go Dumas
<i>père</i> one better, by the aid of modern science;
but, my dear Miles, we must continue to
stick to the old novelist a little while.  So
you'll kindly answer in the usual way when
I ask questions."
</p>

<p>
For a moment Pontifex puffed at his pipe.
Then he took from the table another pipe,
filled it with tobacco, lighted it, and placed
it between the teeth of Hathaway.
</p>

<p>
"Now we'll have a friendly little chat
over our 'baccy, eh?  Real old sailormen,
eh?"  He chuckled with horrible mockery.
"At four bells, Cap'n, they'll come in here
and we'll hold a meeting of the directorate.
The Hathaway Salvage Company&mdash;how's
that, eh?  Sorry you're out of it.  Do you
remember that time in Vladivostok, when
you met me on the street and cursed me
back and forth for marooning those deserters
on an ice-floe?  Well, I told you then that
I'd get even, Miles.  And now&mdash;<i>she</i> is at
sea with me!  Good joke, eh?"
</p>

<p>
The subtle horror-gleam in the eyes of
Miles Hathaway was intensified.  His massive
face purpled, then paled again under its
stubble of whitish beard.
</p>

<p>
"Bo'sun Joe slipped up in letting her get
married," pursued Pontifex.  "But we'll
need her signature and that of her
husband&mdash;or we'll so tell them.  Savvy, Miles?
We'll tell 'em that; we'll make it convincing,
too.  We'll make 'em quite certain that
what we want is their signatures and their
help.  But you know better, Miles!
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you know better.  You know that
I had to get the girl in order to make you
talk, blast you!  That's why I spent money
getting her.  That's why I got her.  As for
Dennis, we'll get rid of him later.  He doesn't
count."
</p>

<p>
Again Pontifex resumed his pipe, puffing
it alight.  He spoke smilingly, now&mdash;an
ugly smile that curved his lips.  He leaned
forward with a swift intent question.
</p>

<p>
"If it's hard to use your eyelids, Miles,
answer with the pipe.  Are you going to
tell me where the <i>John Simpson</i> lays?"
</p>

<p>
Captain Hathaway sent a single spiral of
smoke up-curling from his pipe.
</p>

<p>
"No?"  Pontifex ceased to smile.  "We've
tried torturing you, Miles, and you're as
stubborn a devil as I ever met.  Do you
want us to bring the girl in here and torture
<i>her</i>&mdash;under your eyes?  Hm!  You remember
Frenchy, who put the irons to your feet?
Well&mdash;Frenchy has spoken for her.  And
Frenchy comes aboard at Unalaska.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Miles, if you give me the bearings
of the <i>Simpson</i>, I'll put you and her and
her man ashore at Unalaska, all shipshape.
I give you my solemn word on it, and you
know my word means something; whatever
else I do, I don't break my word!  By the
time we reach Unalaska you'll understand
pretty well how we're going to work on
things.  The day we hit Unimak Pass I'll
ask you once more&mdash;and only once.  If you
refuse, I'll set to work on the girl&mdash;or
Frenchy will.  You think it over, Miles.
You think it over hard, blast you!  Now
that she's here, I'm going to <i>make</i> you
talk!"
</p>

<p>
Pontifex knocked out his pipe and that
of Hathaway.  Then he went on deck.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In the meantime his good wife was
visiting the Dennis cabin.  Florence, for
all her slim frailness, was untouched by
<i>mal-de-mer</i>, and greeted the Missus smilingly.
Tom Dennis, sitting on the lower bunk,
managed a weak grin.  He was rapidly
growing better.
</p>

<p>
"The steward brought yeou breakfast?"
said the Missus, "Is Mr. Dennis feeling
better?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite, I think," responded Florence.
"Surely we're not at sea?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Pontifex nodded.  "Oh, yes, we're
well aoutside Flattery."
</p>

<p>
"And what are we doing there?" demanded
Tom Dennis in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Making abaout nine knots," coolly
returned the Missus, transfixing him with
her deep cold eyes.  "Never mind discussing
it naow.  If yeou folks will show
up in the cabin at four bells, we'll talk it
aout!"
</p>

<p>
"But what does it mean?"  Florence, a
little pale, laid her hand upon the woman's
arm.  Her eyes searched the rocklike features
with anxious pleading.  "Won't you please
tell me?  There's nothing wrong?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing wrong at all, dearie."  Mrs. Pontifex
patted the girl's hand and smiled
a flinty smile.  "It means money in all our
pockets, that's what it means&mdash;aye, in
yours, too!  So don't think too hard of us
for running off to sea with yeou young folks
until ye know all abaout it.
</p>

<p>
"And naow, dearie, I have to do the
cooking, because that blasted cook of ours
went ashore and didn't show up again.
Taking care of your poor father has 'baout
worn me daown, and I know yeou'll be
willing to look after him a bit&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Of course!  I meant to speak to you
about it before this!" exclaimed Florence.
"If you'll show me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Come right along with me.  He ain't
much trouble, poor man, and it's the least
we can do to make him comfortable.  If
there's anything yeou want done, too, just
call steward and tell him."
</p>

<p>
"We'll be back soon, Tom dear," said
Florence, and departed with Mrs. Pontifex.
</p>

<p>
When the door closed, Tom Dennis sat
motionless for a moment, then raised his
head.  He slipped to the deck and stood
upright, holding to the bunk.  A slow smile
crept into his chalky features, and presently
he stretched himself luxuriantly.
</p>

<p>
"Passing off!  I'm bad, but not near so
bad as I might be," he commented audibly.
"It's a good thing for me that I was raised
on the Maine coast, and know ships and
the sea as well as anybody!  They don't
know it, however, and Florence won't tell.
Now, why the deuce have they kidnapped us
this way?"
</p>

<p>
Frowning he sipped some cold coffee from
a pot left by the steward an hour earlier,
Then he went to his huge trunk of a grip,
its telescopic sides fat almost to bursting,
which lay at the head of the bunk.
</p>

<p>
He unlocked the big grip and opened
it.  Then he discarded his shirt and collar,
the same which he had worn the preceding
day, and slipped into a grey flannel shirt
which he took from the suitcase.  His tie
knotted about the collar, he returned to
the grip and knelt above it.  Drawing forth
some clothes, he threw them carelessly on
the floor&mdash;threw out more, until a pile of
rumpled garments lay beside him.  Then
he produced a large flat package and two
small ones.  He opened these, disclosing
six large phonograph records, a reproducer,
and a box of needles.  Then, from within
the suitcase he lifted out a small hornless
phonograph itself.  He stared down at it
and chuckled.
</p>

<p>
"I told Ericksen the truth when I said
I'd given that square suitcase to the porter,"
he reflected, as he fitted the reproducer to
the machine.  "But I didn't mention that
I'd kept the things in the suitcase."
</p>

<p>
Just why he had done this, Tom Dennis
was by no means certain, except that his
suspicions of Ericksen had never quite
downed.  It was very curious that the sole
baggage of the assassin had consisted of
this phonograph outfit.  Bo'sun Joe's interest
in the matter was also curious; his presence
in the compartment belonging to the assassin
had never ceased to trouble Tom Dennis.
More than he cared to admit, Dennis
suspected that there was, or had been, some
definite relation, and by no means an
unfriendly one, between Ericksen and the
would-be murderer.
</p>

<p>
And why had that man possessed nothing
except this phonograph and six grand-opera
records?  Dennis wanted to try out those
records.  He strongly hoped that the labels
might be a blind&mdash;that the records might
have some information to convey.  Did those
records hold the secret, then?
</p>

<p>
Dennis wound up the machine, inserted a
needle in the slot, and set one of the records
upon the turntable.  To his complete and
utter stupefaction he found that upon the
record was not a word; merely a deep bass
voice repeating the alphabet over and over
in a slow and distinct sequence!  After each
letter "zed", followed the numerals from
one to naught.
</p>

<p>
One after another, Dennis tried each of
the six records, patiently listening to that
maddening repetition of that alphabet.  There
was positively nothing else on them!
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
At length he glanced at his watch, found
that it was nearly ten o'clock, or four bells.
With no little disdain and disappointment,
he bundled the phonograph and records back
into the depths of his suitcase, and was
just locking the grip when Florence entered
the cabin.
</p>

<p>
"Are you ready, dear?" she demanded
eagerly, a spot of colour in her pale cheeks.
"They're all waiting for us there in the
cabin&mdash;and, Tom!  It's a company!  The Hathaway
Salvage Company!"
</p>

<p>
"And what does that mean?" asked Dennis
smiling as he kissed her.
</p>

<p>
"They're going to tell us.  Are you better,
dear?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm all right&mdash;able to walk, anyhow.
Forward, and solve the mystery!"
</p>

<p>
Together they left their cabin and went aft.
</p>

<p>
In company with Miles Hathaway and
the tall scarlet geranium in the green-striped
jar, they found five people sitting around
the table.  At the head was Captain Pontifex,
at the foot the Missus.  On one side sat
Mr. Leman, pawing his fringe of whiskers.
At the other sat Ericksen, a satanic twist
to his freckled mouth as he eyed Captain
Hathaway, and at his side the black
boat-steerer, Corny.
</p>

<p>
For a wonder, Pontifex rose as Florence
entered the room, the others following his
example.  The skipper indicated two chairs
placed beside Leman.
</p>

<p>
"Will you sit down, please?  I have the
pleasure of introducing our officers, except
Mr. Mendez, who has the deck.  Mr. Leman,
our second mate; you know Ericksen, I
think, and Corny.  This chair, Mrs. Dennis&mdash;thank
you.  I might add that we are the
officers and directors of the Hathaway Salvage
Company of which I am president, Mrs. Pontifex,
treasurer; Mr. Leman, secretary&mdash;the
other gentlemen directors."
</p>

<p>
Dennis, feeling rather helpless and
bewildered, sank into the chair beside Florence.
</p>

<p>
"For our own protection"&mdash;the skipper
twirled his moustache&mdash;"we have been forced
to maintain silence until we were at sea.
Were it known that Captain Miles Hathaway
were alive, a fortune would be lost to
us all; this one fact will explain many
questions which may have perplexed you,
Mr. Dennis."
</p>

<p>
"A few things need explanation, all right,"
said Dennis.
</p>

<p>
"Conceded!"  The skipper smiled.  "I may
add that we are not bound for the whaling
grounds, and we are not upon a whaling
cruise, as everyone has imagined.  For that
reason we have shipped Kanakas for'ard;
they are faithful good seamen, and ask no
questions.  Neither they nor the other
fo'c'sle hands, of course, are in this
company of ours."
</p>

<p>
"And what is the purpose of the company,
then?" asked Florence quickly.
</p>

<p>
"It may be very briefly stated in one
word: salvage!  Your father's ship, the
<i>John Simpson</i>, was lost at sea with all
hands.  But the natives who brought your
poor father into Unalaska told a story
of having found him upon the shore of an
island, doubtless one of the Aleuts; and
under the lee of that island they had seen
a wreck in water so shallow that her masts
stuck out above the surface.  That wreck
was the <i>Simpson</i>.
</p>

<p>
"You may know that the majority of
those islands are deserted, waterless, good
for nothing.  Not even a Jap sealing poacher
would observe the masts of a wreck, unless
by chance he came to the spot.  We may
take it for granted that the <i>Simpson</i> has
never been found.  Unfortunately, the natives
who brought in Captain Hathaway gave
no exact location and disappeared almost
at once."
</p>

<p>
Tom Dennis leaned forward.  "But why
salvage a ship that's been wrecked?  She's
of no earthly good!  And her cargo will
belong to the owners."
</p>

<p>
"Not so.  She has been taken off the
register!"  Captain Pontifex showed his
white teeth in a smile of perfect confidence.
"The point is this, Mr. Dennis: the ship
was lost while <i>en route</i> to Vladivostok,
laden with supplies for Russia.  Those
supplies consisted of machine-guns almost
entirely; of machine-guns and ammunition.
</p>

<p>
"Water will not have harmed that cargo,
Mr. Dennis&mdash;or if so, only slightly.  I have
taken pains to ascertain that the guns were
so wrapped as to be waterproof.  The value
runs up close to a million and a half of
dollars.  The inference is plain, eh?"
</p>

<p>
Tom Dennis sat back, stunned.  The
inference was plain indeed&mdash;a million and
a half to be had for the picking up!
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap07"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br /><br />
JERRY TELLS SOMETHING
</h3>

<p>
As in a daze, Tom Dennis listened while
Pontifex went on to explain that Miles
Hathaway alone knew where the <i>Simpson</i>
lay; that thus far they had been unable
to find a way to extract that knowledge
from Hathaway&mdash;just here the skipper's
voice was very silky&mdash;and that they counted
upon Florence to hit upon some method of
communication.
</p>

<p>
But, the skipper hastened on, this was
not the real reason for Florence's having
been fetched in person.  She was the legal
heir of Hathaway, and also his guardian,
under the present conditions.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," said Pontifex blandly, "we
might have gone ahead and you would never
have known about it; but we don't do business
that way, Mrs. Dennis.  We want to be
aboveboard and honourable in the matter.
We dared not thresh the thing out there in
the harbour, for you've no idea how curious
shipping people are!  A breath of suspicion
as to our real business, and we'd have been
lost.  So we simply ran away with you&mdash;not
a bad joke, eh?  Ran away with you to make
your fortune!
</p>

<p>
"Well, to business.  Our proposition is
that you sign articles with us&mdash;Mr. Dennis
also, since he is your husband and we want
everything shipshape&mdash;and we'll land you at
Unalaska, there to wait until we've turned
the trick.  Of course, you realize that we're
giving our time, the wages of the men, the
ship, and all the rest, to the venture.  We've
talked over what's fair, and we think that
the right thing to do is to offer you twenty
per centum of the gross proceeds of the salvage.
Is that agreeable?"
</p>

<p>
Florence, her wide brown eyes fastened
upon Tom Dennis, seemed to await his decision
in breathless eagerness.  He nodded, without
speaking.
</p>

<p>
Captain Pontifex produced a paper which
must have been long prepared, for it was
typed, and handed it to Dennis.  The latter
glanced it over.  The writing was no more
than an agreement to the terms as Pontifex
had outlined them: Dennis passed the paper
to Florence.
</p>

<p>
"Pontifex," he said slowly, "you're white
in this thing!  I tell you we appreciate it.
Yes, I can understand a good many things
now that weren't clear to me before.  Your
offer is generous.  It's eminently square.
We're not rich, and if this thing goes through
it'll mean a great deal to us&mdash;and to the
future comfort of Captain Hathaway."
</p>

<p>
Florence hastily signing the paper with
the fountain pen which the skipper had
handed her, shoved pen and paper at Dennis,
then leaped to her feet.  An excited smile upon
her lips, her great brown eyes glowing with
life and eagerness, she insisted on shaking
hands with everyone at the table.  Her
slender frame seemed filled with a sudden
flame of vitality.
</p>

<p>
"You've made me so happy!" she cried,
speaking then to Pontifex.  "Not the money,
not alone what it will mean to us all&mdash;but
your goodness!  All of you!  Oh, if father
could only tell you how he must feel about
it&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She flung her arms around Mrs. Pontifex
and kissed that lady heartily.
</p>

<p>
Up the craggy countenance of the Missus
welled a slow tide of crimson, which swiftly
waned again.  Corny looked at Boatswain
Joe and grinned.  The deep-set, cavernous
eyes of Captain Pontifex sought the impassively
watching face of Miles Hathaway&mdash;sought
it with a satiric gleam in their dark
depths.  Then they returned to the girl.
</p>

<p>
"Duty is duty," he said unctuously.
"We've tried to do what's right, madam.
The consciousness of having done right is a
great stay in time of trouble.  We&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The words were cut short by an appalling
scream which seemed to wail out of the air
overhead, At that scream a silence like death
fell upon the cabin.
</p>

<p>
Corny furtively crossed himself.  Mr. Leman's
flat ugly face turned quite white.
Ericksen flung back his chair and was gone
with a rush.  Captain Pontifex leaped to his
feet and followed Boatswain Joe to the
companion.  As he set foot on the ladder, the
others crowding at his heels, the brig heeled
over amid a confused trampling and shouting
from above.  Florence cried out in fear.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Manuel Mendez was helping a Kanaka
at the wheel, jamming it hard down, bringing
the brig slowly about; he was bawling orders,
while all hands were trimming sail.
</p>

<p>
"One o' dem lubbers fell off de royal
yard!" bellowed Mendez at the skipper.
He did not think it necessary to explain
that, as a good joke, he had sent one of the
drink-dazed white hands up to the royal,
grinning delightedly as the poor devil shivered
and clung in fright above the swimming
waste of water.  But another of the white
men forward had seen.
</p>

<p>
"It was him done it!" yelled the man
angrily, pointing at Mendez.  "He shifted the
helm to&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Boatswain Joe's fist stopped the utterance,
sent the man rolling into the scuppers.
</p>

<p>
"Get out that for'ard boat, Bo'sun!"
shouted Captain Pontifex, his voice piercing
the wind as steel pierces paper.  "Lively,
now&mdash;lively!"
</p>

<p>
Tom Dennis stood at the top of the
companionway, his arm about Florence.  Beside
him stood the Missus, rocklike and silent.
Dennis had caught those words from forward,
and seen Ericksen's blow; he stood grimly
watching, his lips compressed.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Leman, with uncanny swiftness, joined
Boatswain Joe at the forward whaleboat.
It was quickly swung out and lowered, the
Kanakas tumbling into it, Leman and
Ericksen following.  Behind, somewhere in the
tossing sea crests, was the black dot of a man's
head.  Before the boat was half-way to it, the
head had vanished.  The man was gone.
</p>

<p>
"Be a little more careful with those men,
Mr. Mendez," said Pontifex, watching the
whaleboat put about and return.  "We'll
need 'em."
</p>

<p>
That was all.  No anger, no inquiry, no
more concern over the death of a man&mdash;the
needless brutal murder of a man&mdash;than if
that man had been a wandering sea-gull.
Tom Dennis drew Florence below, hoping
that she had not understood.  But when he
looked into her eyes, he knew that she <i>had</i>
understood.
</p>

<p>
"Tom, I&mdash;can't believe it!" she said
faintly, horror in her wide brown eyes.
"He spoke as though&mdash;it didn't matter."
</p>

<p>
Dennis made light of the affair.  "Never
mind, dear.  We don't know all the circumstances,
and of course the skipper can't blame
his mate in public.  It would hurt
discipline.  Just try and forget it, and not refer
to it."
</p>

<p>
The girl shivered.  "I can't forget that
awful scream!"
</p>

<p>
No further reference was made to the
affair, beyond the skipper's explaining, later,
that an unavoidable lurch of the ship had
caused the accident.  But it was long before
Florence could look upon Manuel Mendez,
when he joined them at mess, without
changing countenance.  There was something
dreadful in the grinning calm of the black
Portuguese.  His eternal good humour was
ominous.
</p>

<p>
"We mustn't let little outside matters
affect us," said Tom Dennis that same night.
"The main point, Florence, so far as we're
concerned, is your father, and the way
Pontifex and his company are acting."
</p>

<p>
"I know, Tom, dear," she said.  "They've
been very good."
</p>

<p>
He sensed a constraint in her air, but put
it down to the accident.
</p>

<p>
Two days later, however, the inquietude
within him, which had been lulled to sleep
by that meeting of the company, was awakened
with terrible swiftness.  He had been
discussing with Pontifex how to get into
communication with Miles Hathaway, and
the skipper professed himself quite helpless
in the matter, leaving it entirely to Florence's
ingenuity.
</p>

<p>
The lack of concern which Pontifex expressed
struck Tom Dennis as being unnatural,
under the circumstances.  But a little later,
as Dennis stood in talk with Mr. Leman, who
was discussing whaling voyages, he squinted
up at the sails.
</p>

<p>
"Better trim your yards a bit, hadn't
you?" said Dennis thoughtlessly.  "Looks
as if you were losing a good bit of that wind,
Mr. Leman."
</p>

<p>
The mate started slightly.
</p>

<p>
"Where'd you learn so much about sails,
Mr. Dennis?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I just picked it up," Dennis laughed.
"But if you're in a hurry to reach Unalaska,
I should think you'd trim sail a bit."
</p>

<p>
"Orders were to keep her as she is," said
Leman curtly, and turned away.
</p>

<p>
Dennis shrugged his shoulders.  It was
none of his business how the ship was run,
and if Pontifex had reasons for not hurrying,
well and good.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Meantime, the silent and motionless Miles
Hathaway sat in the cabin, puffing sometimes
at the pipe Florence filled for him, watching
her as she worked, with unmoving terrible
eyes.  Tom helped her take care of him, and
always it seemed to Dennis that Hathaway
was mutely struggling to express something.
Once Dennis got out a chart and attempted
to locate the wreck.
</p>

<p>
"Watch my finger, Captain Hathaway,"
he directed.  "If I get 'warm', as the kids
used to say, open your mouth."
</p>

<p>
The effort was fruitless, for although
Dennis traced his fingers over the entire
line of the Aleuts, Miles Hathaway remained
unmoving.  In the end, Dennis began to think
that the man either did not understand, or
possessed a brain as dead as his body.  At
times, too, the paralytic was almost unable
to open his mouth or to swallow.  His lips
had no independent motion.  To communicate
with him seemed impossible.
</p>

<p>
It was the third evening following the
meeting in the cabin.  Tom and Florence had
put Hathaway to bed, and after bidding the
skipper and his wife good night, went on deck
for a breath of air.  Mendez had the deck.
Wishing to avoid the black mate, Florence
led the way forward to the lee of the brick
try-works.  There Tom Dennis lighted his
pipe, and for a little they sat together in
silence, under the strangely soothing yet
invigorating influence of the slapping sails
and the rushing foam-crested rollers that
roared under the lee-rail.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a figure appeared coming from
aft, preceded by a whimpering sniffle.  It
was Jerry, the moon-faced cabin boy and
he was blubbering away with the subdued
racking sobs of a boy.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, Jerry!" said Dennis.  "What's
the trouble?"
</p>

<p>
Jerry peered at them and rubbed his eyes,
</p>

<p>
"The Missus whaled me; then he chipped
in and kicked the back off'm me, drat him!"
</p>

<p>
"What'd you do, Jerry?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothin' at all!" responded the boy
defiantly.  "The mate sent me down to clean
his cabin, an' they didn't know I was there,
an' the door was open.  He says it's a hell
of a note about Frenchy not bringin' that
phonygraft, and it was the best idea ever
was, and she says yes, maybe we'd better
give the old son of a gun another taste of hot
iron.  He says no, there ain't no need of that,
because we got the bulge on him now and
he'll talk in a hurry, knowin' she's aboard,
and it's all Bo'sun's fault for slippin' up
and lettin' Frenchy slip up that way.  Just
then they heard me, and she whaled me and
he kicked me up the ladder.  Drat him!  I
wisht I was off'm this old ship!"
</p>

<p>
Jerry passed on forward, sniffling.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Tom Dennis stood very still.  He felt
Florence draw herself up; he caught a
startled gasp from her lips; but he was thinking
with a wild sickening surety, of what the
skipper had said.  Frenchy&mdash;and the phonograph!
</p>

<p>
There was the missing link.  No use
disguising the facts any longer; no use trying
to cover up what was only too obvious!
Frenchy&mdash;that was the assassin; and Ericksen
<i>had</i> been in partnership with him, there
in Chicago!  And Hathaway would talk now
that Florence was aboard&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Tom Dennis shivered suddenly.  "Come,
dear!" he said in a strange voice.  "Come
below.  I have something to tell you."
</p>

<p>
He felt that she was sobbing softly, and
halted.  "What's the matter, Florence?"
</p>

<p>
She only shook her head, and taking his
arm accompanied him to the companionway.
Dennis was alarmed by her attitude; upon
reaching their own cabin she threw her arms
about him, a sudden paroxysm of sobs shaking
her whole body.  Dennis could obtain no
response to his queries for a moment, until
the girl suddenly looked up into his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I couldn't tell you before, Tom!
I thought perhaps it had been the wreck,
and all that," she said, brokenly.  "But
poor father&mdash;his feet were burned, and his
arms&mdash;at least, I know now that the scars
were of burns!  You heard what Jerry said.
And father's eyes are giving him a lot of
trouble; sometimes he can't use them at all,
and it seems to hurt him when they're open.
I&mdash;I can't dare to think that anyone would
have deliberately hurt him&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord!" broke from Dennis.  "It's
not credible!  Yet, if Frenchy was my
Chicago visitor&mdash;here, old girl, sit down!
I've something to tell you.  I can't quite
face the meaning of it&mdash;yet it's bound to
mean but one thing&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He drew the wondering sobbing girl
to a chair beside him, and for the first time
told her of his strange assailant in Chicago
on the night of their departure.  He connected
up the links&mdash;finding Ericksen in the man's
compartment; the square suitcase and its
contents&mdash;and now the remarks of Pontifex
about that phonograph, as reported by the
innocent Jerry.
</p>

<p>
As she listened, the apprehension and grief
of Florence for the helpless and seemingly
tortured father began to be absorbed in the
deep significance of the entire affair.  She
sat in frowning thought, while Dennis drew
from his memory the little things which at
the time he had scarce noted, but which now
seemed so laden with significance&mdash;even the
strange unconcern of Pontifex over communicating
with Miles Hathaway.  At this last,
Florence lifted her head.
</p>

<p>
"I know&mdash;the same thing struck me,
Tom.  I was talking about it with Mrs. Pontifex
to-day; she had the air of discouraging
me in the attempt.  Why?  Why don't
they want us to communicate with poor
father?  It will be hard at best, because of
his eyes; I'm going to make up an eyewash
for him until we can reach a doctor.  But
why their attitude?  Everything seemed so
honest and so kindly at that meeting the other
day!  And when I kissed Mrs. Pontifex&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"She blushed, by George!" snapped
Dennis suddenly.  "And anything that could
make that woman blush&mdash;here, let me think!
Jerry gave the whole game away to us.  The
clue lies in what the skipper said about
your father talking now that you were
aboard&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
He broke off abruptly, filled and lighted his
pipe, and sat staring before him.  Not for
nothing had he followed the newspaper game.
Not for nothing had he been one of the best
rewrite men in Chicago!  He had been trained
in the business of making a whole cloth from
scattered scraps.
</p>

<p>
"Got it!  Listen here, Florence," he said
suddenly.  "Pontifex found your father, and
either took him to a house, where those
snapshots were made, or to this ship&mdash;no
matter which.  Face facts, now!  All this
goody-goody talk is bluff.  Pontifex was busy
trying to extort the secret of the <i>Simpson's</i>
position from your father, so he sent Boatswain
Joe to get you; and he sent that clever
little assassin, Frenchy, to get this phonograph
that's in my grip&mdash;why, we don't know.
But for some reason he wanted it, and wanted
it badly!
</p>

<p>
"Ericksen did not want me to accompany
you.  He called in Frenchy at the last minute
to put me out of the way&mdash;and Frenchy
meant murder.  There's a salient fact!  How
did Boatswain Joe slip up, as Pontifex
termed it?  In not bringing you alone.
They wanted you&mdash;alone!  A second salient
fact.  Why?  Pontifex has said it: in order
to force your father to talk!"
</p>

<p>
"But Tom!" broke in Florence quickly.
"Father can't talk!"
</p>

<p>
"All bluff.  Pontifex can communicate
with him, somehow.  They simply didn't
want us to do so."
</p>

<p>
"But that's why they wanted <i>me</i>!  And
then, my signature on that paper&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"More bluff!" flung out Dennis.  "They
tortured your father&mdash;don't shrink from it&mdash;and
he would not tell the secret.  They got you
aboard and sailed, knowing that for your
sake, to get you out of their power, your
father would give up anything.  I'm a mere
incident, an incumbrance.  They're not
hurrying.  They want Frenchy to reach
Unalaska first and come aboard there.  I'd
recognize him again, which would spoil
their game at this juncture."
</p>

<p>
"They don't mean to land us there?"  She
spoke steadily, but her face was pale.
</p>

<p>
"I doubt it.  They'll try to get rid of me
there.  They may take you and your father
along, to be sure that they get the right
position from him.  The ultimate outcome
would be probably of no danger to you&mdash;they'd
sell the salvaged stuff to Japan or
Canada or China, and would land you
wherever they went.  They might even keep
the signed agreement&mdash;in part.  They'd
give you enough money to make it inadvisable
for you to start any legal proceedings, as
they have your agreement to the terms, and
you'll never know how much they get for the
salvage.  You understand?  If your father
gives them the correct position of the wreck,
you are possibly in no danger."
</p>

<p>
"And you, Tom?"
</p>

<p>
Dennis grinned.  "They want me out of
the way.  They think I'll make trouble.
Well, I <i>know</i> I will!  Don't you worry about
me.  They'll do nothing until Unalaska and
the revenue cutter are left behind, see?
And by that time, little Tommy will have
spoiled their game."
</p>

<p>
"How?" demanded Florence, her eyes anxious.
</p>

<p>
"Don't know yet," said Dennis cheerfully.
"If I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Tom!  What was it that Pontifex said
to you about reading Dumas?  Why, I
I know just what they got that phonograph
for&mdash;oh, I wish I'd known about it!"
</p>

<p>
"You do?  What?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't you remember in one of the Dumas
novels there was a paralytic, and they made
him blink his eyelids twice for 'No' and once
for 'Yes'?  I was thinking about it only this
afternoon, and meant to try it with father!
And those phonograph records, with the
alphabet and numerals on them&mdash;don't you
see?  Play a record and father would wink
at the right letter of figure until he spelled
out a word&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"By George!"  Dennis stared at the flushed
and excited girl.  "By George!  You've hit
it square on the head&mdash;and I never thought of
it!  We'll try it to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Florence leaned forward, colour glowing
in her pale face, her eyes dilated by swift
excitement and resolution, yet dominated
by their strangely poised radiance.  All her
spirit shone in her eyes&mdash;all her heritage of
soul, her heritage of iron nature, tempered
and alloyed and refined to an almost dangerous
degree by her womanhood.  Tom Dennis
gazed into her eyes and wondered, as he
had wondered on that memorable afternoon
when she had said: "We'll only win by
daring; so we shall dare everything!"
</p>

<p>
"No, Tom!" she said firmly.  "Not the
phonograph!  They must not know that we
have it, or they'll know that we suspect their
whole game!  In the morning I'll corroborate
your theory from father's lips&mdash;the way that
Dumas' story did.  We have two or three more
days until we reach Unalaska.  In that time
don't dare give them any suspicion!  Watch
everything; but say nothing.
</p>

<p>
"Before we reach Unalaska we'll formulate
a plan of action between us.  They have
bitterly wronged us; they have lied to us;
they've tried to murder us.  And we'll fight
them!  Do you agree?"
</p>

<p>
Tom Dennis laughed suddenly and kissed
her on the lips.
</p>

<p>
"You bet!" he said deeply.  "We'll fight!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br /><br />
MILES HATHAWAY TALKS
</h3>

<p>
Close upon noon the following day, moon-faced
Jerry was heading for the after cabins,
broom in hand, with intent to sweep up the
mess cabin.  Manuel Mendez, who had the
deck, playfully whipped out his sheath-knife,
and pretended to dive for Jerry.
With a howl of terror, the boy slashed the
mate's shins with the broom-handle&mdash;a wild
blow.
</p>

<p>
"Leave go o' me, you nigger!" he howled,
as the hand of Mendez caught his collar.
</p>

<p>
"Who you call nigger?  Me?" demanded
Manuel Mendez angrily.  "What you t'ink
dis ship be, huh?  You say 'sir' to de mate,
queeck!"
</p>

<p>
One giant black hand encircling the boy's
throat; Mendez laughed and choked him
until Jerry's face was purple.  Then, having
heard the desired "sir", Mendez flung Jerry
at the companionway which swallowed him
from sight.
</p>

<p>
At the bottom of the ladder, Jerry
perceived Captain Pontifex bearing his
instruments and going above for the noon
observation.  Jerry sidled into the nearest cabin
and hid.  He knew that the Missus was up
forward in the galley, safely engaged in
getting dinner.
</p>

<p>
Thus it happened that when Florence went
swiftly to the stern cabin, and Tom Dennis
stood upon the companion ladder to give her
warning of any approaching danger from
above, neither of them knew that moon-faced
Jerry was fearfully waiting and listening
inside the cabin of Mendez, the door slightly
ajar.  And that cabin adjoined the stern
cabin.
</p>

<p>
"Father&mdash;can you wink your eyelids once
for 'yes' and twice for 'no'?  Quickly!"
</p>

<p>
Florence stood before the immobile figure
of her father, watching him with anxious
desperate eyes.  The eyes of Miles Hathaway
winked&mdash;very slowly, very slightly, but
very perceptibly.  Was it chance or design?
</p>

<p>
"Have you given the position of the wreck
to Captain Pontifex?" breathed the girl.
Her father's eyes closed twice.  A sudden glory
shone in her face, as she realized that this was
no accident&mdash;that she was communicating
with her father at last!
</p>

<p>
"You heard all that passed at the meeting
here," she hurried on.  "Was he sincere in
what he said?  Does he mean to keep his
promises to us?"
</p>

<p>
The eyelids of the paralytic fluttered twice.
</p>

<p>
"Have they harmed you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Can we trust anyone aboard here?"
</p>

<p>
No answer.  Evidently Hathaway was not
sure upon this point.
</p>

<p>
"Have they any intentions of harming me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"They have!  And Tom too?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Yes."  Repeated, this time, manifestly
for emphasis.  The girl paled slightly.
</p>

<p>
"Will they harm us before we reach Unalaska?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
Tom Dennis began to whistle cheerily.
Florence, who had filled her father's pipe,
put it between his lips and held a match
while he puffed.  As she did so, the door
behind her was flung open, and into the cabin
came Tom, propelling before him the cabin
boy Jerry.
</p>

<p>
"Heard everything you said, Florence,"
said Dennis, surveying the shrinking boy.
"Now, Jerry, what d'you mean by spying on
us?  Who set you in there to listen?"
</p>

<p>
"Nobody."  Jerry began to blubber.
"But that nigger Mendez kicked me downstairs,
and I seen <i>him</i> comin', and I ducked
in there.  I didn't mean to hear nothing
honest!  And I won't tell them, neither, if
ye let me go.  Don't whale me!"
</p>

<p>
"Lord, Jerry, I wouldn't hurt you!"
said Dennis; but he frowned as he spoke.
He looked at Florence and gestured helplessly.
If the boy told&mdash;their game was done!
</p>

<p>
"Jerry," said the girl, suddenly stooping
and kissing the gaping boy, "do you like
Captain Pontifex?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't!  I hate him!  And if we
ever get anywhere, I'm going to run away."
</p>

<p>
"He hates us, Jerry.  Do you want to go
away from this ship with us?
</p>

<p>
"You bet, ma'am.  Can I?"
</p>

<p>
"If you don't say a word to anyone about
what you just heard.  If you do, Mr. Dennis
and I will suffer, and you'll get no chance
to run away."
</p>

<p>
"Cross m'heart, ma'am."  And Jerry
earnestly suited action to word.  A sudden
excitement shone in his eyes.  "They've
double-crossed you all the time.  I know;
I've heard 'em talk!  They're goin' to give
you to that man Frenchy, that used to be
cook.  I never seen him, but they talk about
him lots."
</p>

<p>
"All right, Jerry," said Dennis hastily.
"Beat it before the skipper comes back."
</p>

<p>
The boy fled.  Dennis looked at the flushed
hurt face of Florence.
</p>

<p>
"Give me&mdash;to that man!" she said faintly.
"Oh!  It&mdash;it's impossible&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Right, old girl&mdash;it's quite impossible."  Dennis
made a gesture of caution, as he heard
the sound of steps from the passage.  "You
leave it to me, that's all.  I'm sorry you heard
that, Florence; but it'll be all right.  Better
take that pipe from your father, or we'll
forget it.  Eight bells just struck and we'd
better run along to dinner."
</p>

<p>
The skipper entered, with a smiling nod and
a twirl of his moustache.
</p>

<p>
"Unalaska day after to-morrow, if the
wind hold," he announced, his deep-set eyes
flitting from face to face as if seeking secrets
there.  "All's well?"
</p>

<p>
"All well and hungry, skipper."  Dennis
turned to the door.  "Coming?"
</p>

<p>
"Not for five minutes.  I want to jot down
these figures and work out our position."
</p>

<p>
During the meal which ensued, Tom
Dennis marvelled at the manner in which
Florence maintained her cool poise, with
never a token to indicate the terrific ordeal to
which she had so lately been subjected.  And
little Jerry, his moon-face white and frightened,
served the table with an occasional adoring
glance at the girl; the danger from Jerry
was palpably eliminated.
</p>

<p>
To dare risk further conversation with
Miles Hathaway would be unadvisable,
Dennis realized.  Discussing the matter with
Florence that afternoon, he found all traces
of excitement gone from her; she was coolly
alert, and much better poised than was
Dennis himself.  Fury was so deep and strong
within him that it was difficult for him
to restrain his passion; but Florence had
become quite cool and dispassionate.
</p>

<p>
"It is quite clear, Tom," she said quietly,
"that we must get father off this ship at
Unalaska.  If the revenue cutter is there,
you had better interview the commander,
tell exactly what has happened, and have
father placed ashore.  If the revenue cutter is
not there, the port authorities&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Will probably be too slow to act," put
in Dennis.  "And there's another thing&mdash;this
ship has diving equipment aboard, with all
things necessary for the work in hand.  I
want to go after the wreck of the <i>Simpson</i>,
Florence: I believe that Pontifex will be
only too glad to set us all ashore at Unalaska
provided he could get the location of that
wreck."
</p>

<p>
"But he wouldn't trust father to give
him the correct location.  He'd hold us, or
hold father, as hostages."
</p>

<p>
Dennis nodded, frowningly.  After a moment
he rose.
</p>

<p>
"Dear, please go to your father at once,
Tell him that it is absolutely essential that
he give Pontifex the correct location of that
wreck.  Tell him that I shall handle the entire
matter in such a way that Pontifex will
ultimately get his just desserts; but for the
present it is necessary that Pontifex should
not suspect us."
</p>

<p>
"And you, Tom?  What are you going to do now?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to see the skipper&mdash;I think he's
on deck.  If your father consents to do as I
request, please call us at once."
</p>

<p>
Dennis hurried out to the companion way,
and ascended to the deck.
</p>

<p>
Pontifex was there, indeed&mdash;tall and cavernous,
caressing his curled black moustache
while he talked with Mr. Leman.  Dennis
approached them with his heartiest manner.
</p>

<p>
"Well, gentlemen, good news!" he said
warmly.  "Do you remember, Captain,
mentioning Dumas to me when we came
aboard?  That gave us an idea, and I believe
that Mrs. Dennis will be able to communicate
with her father.  In fact, I expect her to
call us down there at any moment to get the
location of that wreck.  Pretty good, eh?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Leman rubbed his broken nose.  The
skipper gave Dennis a sharp look, then forced
a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Why, certainly, Mr. Dennis!  Very glad
indeed to hear it.  The means?"
</p>

<p>
"By Captain Hathaway's winking his eyes
in response to certain questions.  Simple,
if we'd only thought about it, eh?  And,
Captain, Mrs. Dennis and I both think that
when we reach Unalaska she had better be
put ashore there with her father.  She's rather
worried over his condition, and she'd be able
to secure comforts ashore which can't be had
here."
</p>

<p>
Pontifex nodded absently.  His pallid
features looked very uneasy.
</p>

<p>
"Then you'd go on with us?" he asked
after a moment.
</p>

<p>
"Of course!" assented Dennis heartily.
"Don't you want me?"
</p>

<p>
"You bet we do!" returned the skipper
fervently, his face clearing.  "We'll need
every man aboard when the work begins."
</p>

<p>
"Good&mdash;then it's settled!" exclaimed
Dennis.  "When do we make Unimak Pass?"
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow night," spoke up Mr. Leman,
and fell to discussing the weather.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Five minutes later Florence appeared on
deck, smiled and nodded brightly as the two
officers touched their caps, and approached
them with well-assumed eagerness.
</p>

<p>
"I can talk with father!" she exclaimed
as though the discovery were fresh.  "Come,
down, gentlemen!  He knows exactly what
I'm saying, Tom, and winks once for 'yes' and
twice for 'no'!  I asked if he'd give us the
exact location of the wreck, and he said
'yes'; so I came to call you at once."
</p>

<p>
"Excellent, Mrs. Dennis!  I congratulate
you," exclaimed the skipper.  "Mr. Leman
cannot leave the deck.  I'll call Mr. Mendez
as we go down.  Well, well, Mrs. Dennis!
Your husband was just telling us of the method
of communication.  Quite ingenious, quite!
By the way, have you seen Mrs. Pontifex?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Leman, who entirely disregarded the
conventional title of the lady, sang out in
quick response:
</p>

<p>
"The Missus is up for'ard in the galley.
Ahoy, Corny!  Pass up the word for the
Missus!"
</p>

<p>
So the word was "passed up", and the large
figure of Mrs. Pontifex appeared near the
try-works as Florence descended the
companion ladder.  With the Missus at the end
of the procession, the others passed on into
the stern cabin, the skipper knocking at the
door of Manuel Mendez <i>en route</i> and
commanding his immediate presence.
</p>

<p>
"Best do this all shipshape," suggested
the skipper, when they stood before and around
the immobile figure of Miles Hathaway.
"I'll get out a chart, Mrs. Dennis&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Pontifex searched his chart locker and did
not find the desired chart until Manuel
Mendez appeared, smiling his eternal and
monstrous grin.  Then Pontifex produced a
chart of the Aleutian Islands.
</p>

<p>
"Now, ma'am," he addressed Florence,
"while I read off the figures to your poor old
father, you stand by to watch for the answers.
All ready?  Good.  Let's take up the latitude
first&mdash;easier to determine the position that
way.  Now, is the position north of fifty-four?"
</p>

<p>
"No," returned Florence almost at once.
</p>

<p>
"Hm!  That cuts out everything north of
Dutch Harbour, eh?  North of fifty-two?"
</p>

<p>
"No," answered Florence.
</p>

<p>
"Good enough, ma'am.  Now let's take
up the longitude.  West from Greenwich?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Between one seventy-four and seventy-eight?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Between one seventy-eight and eighty?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes!" exclaimed Florence.
</p>

<p>
"Getting warm, eh?" Pontifex spoke
eagerly, a tinge of red in his pale cheeks.  "Ah!
It's among that clump of islands south-east
of Tanaga.  Now, Mr. Hathaway, kindly
follow my pencil from island to island with
your eyes, this way&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The skipper slowly passed the point of a
pencil from one barren rock island to another.
A swift cry from Florence checked him;
holding his pencil, he gazed steadily at
Miles Hathaway.
</p>

<p>
"Is this it?" he demanded, a sudden ring
of steel in his tone.  "This one&mdash;the most
southerly of the rocks to the eastward of
Kavalga?"
</p>

<p>
The gaze of one and all centred upon Miles
Hathaway who for a moment met the level
gaze of Pontifex with unmoving eyes.  Then,
slowly, Hathaway signified "Yes".
</p>

<p>
A deep breath filled the cabin; but the
tense attitude of Pontifex did not change.
He held his eyes steadily upon those of
Hathaway.  His voice came like a challenge,
steely and commanding.
</p>

<p>
"Is that the correct position, Captain
Hathaway&mdash;upon your word of honour?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," signalled Hathaway immediately.
</p>

<p>
Captain Pontifex turned.  He rolled up
the chart and tossed it upon the table.
</p>

<p>
"Hathaway's word is as good as my
own&mdash;and that means <i>good</i>," he said quietly.
"Now, Mrs. Dennis, am I correct in believing
that you wish to be set ashore with your
father at Unalaska?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."  Florence looked at him, smiling.
"I'll be sorry to miss the salvage work,
Captain Pontifex, but I'd like to obtain
medical aid for my father, and to care for
him ashore in person.  He's more important
to me than any money, you understand?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course."  And Pontifex nodded.
</p>

<p>
The Missus was watching him in unconcealed
surprise, while Mendez had ceased
entirely to smile.  This was their first hint
about setting anyone ashore.  Pontifex
caressed his moustache and glanced at them,
his deep-set eyes ironic.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Dennis and Captain Hathaway shall
be set ashore at Unalaska," he said.
"Mr. Dennis goes with us as their representative,
to take part in the work on the <i>Simpson</i>.  I
think that concludes our meeting."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Five minutes later, in the privacy of their
own cabin, Florence faced Tom Dennis, her
hands on his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Dear, I had hard work to make father
consent," she said quietly.  "But he yielded
to my love and utter confidence in you.  Now
tell me&mdash;why did you do it?  Do you really
mean to go alone with these men, on this
ship?"
</p>

<p>
Dennis filled his pipe, stooped to kiss her
lips, then struck a match.
</p>

<p>
"I most certainly do, my dear.  The
chances are a thousand to one that the revenue
cutter will not be in Unalaska Bay.  In that
event, you and your father will go ashore,
while I shall sail with the <i>Pelican</i>.  You'll
take my big grip ashore, containing that
phonograph and records.  By this means your
father can tell his entire story to the proper
authorities.  That will take time, of course,
and it will take time to summon the revenue
cutter, even by wireless.
</p>

<p>
"I believe that under the circumstances, I
an oath can be administered to your father
in a perfectly legal manner.  You know the
position of the wreck.  With your father's
story as a basis for action you can go to work
in a proper manner with the authorities;
whatever charges your father lays against
Pontifex can be sworn to; your own signature
to the agreement with Pontifex was obtained
by fraud and deceit.
</p>

<p>
"You understand?  Do nothing in a
hurry.  Give us a clear two weeks in which to
get this ship loaded with the salvaged stuff.
Then get sharp quick action, file a libel, or
whatever the term is to denote an attachment
of the ship.  Sue Pontifex heavily in
both your father's name and in ours, and
claim whatever he has salvaged in your own
name.  We'll grab his ship and his salvaged
stuff at one swoop, see?  While that's going
through the courts, we will gut the <i>John
Simpson</i> of all that's left in her.  There's a
newspaper man in Vancouver named Margate;
I'll give you cables to send off to him.  He'll
doubtless be able to get backing and to
charter some kind of an old tub&mdash;and while
Pontifex is in the courts with us, Margate will
be looting the <i>Simpson</i>, before the general
public gets wise to where the <i>John Simpson</i>
is lying.  See?"
</p>

<p>
The eyes of the girl were large with
wonder-admiration, and delight.  Then fear struck
into their depths.
</p>

<p>
"The plan is wonderful, Tom!  But you&mdash;in
the meantime?"
</p>

<p>
Dennis grinned.  "Me?  I'll be jollying old
Pontifex along; never fear!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br /><br />
UNALASKA BAY
</h3>

<p>
Unalaska&mdash;at last!
</p>

<p>
The tortuous, narrow and even precipitous
passage, winding nearly two miles amid the
rocks, lay behind, and now the good ship
<i>Pelican</i> was swinging to her anchor in front
of the little town hardly more than a village.
In the little bight was no other large craft,
although several fishing boats were rocking
to their moorings.
</p>

<p>
The Arctic summer, intense and vivid
as though to make up for its brief duration,
was at an end.  None the less, the breeze
from the shore carried a sweet fragrance of
flowers, the little town was still radiant with
blossoming gardens, and all over the hills
which lay banked around the town there were
patches of gay flowers and the deep lush green
of rank grasses.
</p>

<p>
With great care Miles Hathaway and
his wheeled chair were lowered into a boat.
Tom Dennis and Florence followed, together
with Captain Pontifex, who had proffered his
services in securing a place of abode for
Florence and her father.  Once upon the dock,
Dennis took charge of the chair, and all three
started up-town, Pontifex carrying Dennis'
big suitcase.
</p>

<p>
"Feels good to have the solid earth underfoot
again," said Dennis.  "How long do you
expect to lay up here, Skipper?"
</p>

<p>
"We'll go out with the tide to-night,"
returned Pontifex.  "I expect to pick up a
cook here, who was to reach Unalaska by one
of the island steamers, and I want to get
our mail and papers.  If we can get
Mrs. Dennis comfortably berthed this afternoon,
there'll be nothing to detain us, beyond
standing off her trunk."
</p>

<p>
"Besides," he added in a lowered voice,
"I'm anxious not to let the news slip out
of what we're after.  Before we could get
clear of the island we'd have schooners
dogging us.  In case Mrs. Dennis would like any
ready money&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Captain, I need nothing,"
said Florence quietly.
</p>

<p>
Little Jerry had not been allowed to come
ashore, much to the disappointment of
Florence, who had been bent upon rescuing the
lad.  Dennis, however, had already formulated
a plan of action, largely because he considered
that the boy's testimony would be of
tremendous weight in backing up Florence when
she interviewed the authorities.
</p>

<p>
An hour later, with the afternoon half
gone, Florence and Captain Hathaway were
snugly ensconced as paying guests in a
cottage not far behind the ancient Greek church.
Captain Pontifex had departed on his own
business.
</p>

<p>
"Dear, are you <i>sure</i>?"  In the security of her
hired room, with the immobile Miles Hathaway
watching them from his chair, Florence
sought the gaze of Tom Dennis.  To him it
seemed that her eye held a glowing probe of
fire, searching his very soul.
</p>

<p>
"Remember, Tom dear, that I mustn't
lose you.  You're my one sure strong anchor
in the world; your love and you are necessary
to me," she said steadily.  "So are you sure?
Are you sure that the best plan would not be
to stop here ashore and have Pontifex placed
under restraint&mdash;here and now?
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure that we had not best let
the thought of money and salvage go for
the present, placing our own lives and safety
first of all?  Are you sure you can come back
to me, my dear?"
</p>

<p>
Despite the brave soul of her, at those
last words her voice faltered.
</p>

<p>
"Dear wife, I am sure," said Dennis
simply.  "I shall play the game safely,
letting them suspect nothing of what I
know, and before any crisis occurs you will
have acted.  Two weeks&mdash;remember!"
</p>

<p>
"And you think Pontifex will suspect
nothing if Jerry disappears to-night?"
</p>

<p>
"He would not consent to leave you and
your father here together, knowing that you
can communicate, if he suspected anything.
He will think that Jerry has run away,
and will doubtless figure on picking up the
boy when he returns&mdash;he'll be too anxious
to reach the <i>John Simpson</i> to bother about
suspicions.  It has not occurred to him that
you would ask your father any questions out
of the ordinary, and certainly your father
cannot tell anything of what has happened
unless asked.  You have the phonograph and
records in that valise, so go ahead and don't
worry about me, dear.  I'll play my part."
</p>

<p>
"Agreed, dear."  She leaned forward and
held up her face to his.  "Then let's leave
father here, and go out to see the town;
we'll spend our last hours together, before
you go, and you can arrange about poor little
Jerry."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
An hour afterward, a grizzled old fisherman
was listening to Tom Dennis and shaking
his head in stubborn negation.
</p>

<p>
"Not me, sir!" he affirmed with emphasis.
"I dassn't run around the harbour without
no light&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But your lantern might go out for five
minutes!"
</p>

<p>
"Not mine, sir.  Besides, helpin' a feller
escape from a whaler ain't no jokin' matter!
Fact it ain't.  I'd like to earn the money
all right, but I dassn't buck up ag'in the
law."
</p>

<p>
Florence gave her husband a meaning glance.
</p>

<p>
"Tom, please let me speak to him in
private a moment!"
</p>

<p>
Shrugging his shoulders, Dennis walked
away.  As he strode up and down, he saw
that Florence was speaking very earnestly,
and that the grizzled fisherman seemed very
uneasy.  But presently the fisherman grinned
and nodded, shaking hands with Florence.
He had agreed.
</p>

<p>
"What on earth did you say to him?"
demanded Dennis, as they were walking away.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I made it clear that he'd be doing a
good deed&mdash;that's all."  A ripple of laughter
danced like sunlight across her face.  "Why,
from what you said, the poor man thought he
would be compounding a felony!"
</p>

<p>
Dennis chuckled.  "I guess a man would be
willing to compound anything, if you'd smile
at him and beg him to do it!  Well, you're
right about the good-deed part of it, and I'm
glad it's settled.  Let's look up some supper
ashore; then I'll go aboard ship."
</p>

<p>
The skipper had promised to send a boat
ashore for Dennis; so, when darkness was
beginning to fall, he hailed the brigantine
from the dock, Florence at his side.  Five
minutes later a whaleboat was pulling in,
with Ericksen in the stern.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, my dear, and God bring you
back safely," said Florence softly, as she
kissed him good-bye.
</p>

<p>
Dennis answered with a reassuring smile.
"You've got my little flash-light, haven't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Everything as planned, my heart.  Good-bye!"
</p>

<p>
Dennis climbed down into the boat which
swept around and headed back to the brig.
Florence stood on the dock, watching.  She
exchanged a final wave of the hand before the
boat swept out of sight under the counter of
the <i>Pelican</i>; then she turned and slowly
walked in to the shore.
</p>

<p>
There, however, she remained, in the
shadow of the long warehouses already piled
high with bone from other whaling ships.
Darkness closed down upon the bay, and the
lights of the little town began to glimmer and
gleam under the hills.  Out on the water
the lamps of the <i>Pelican</i> showed red and white
in the gloom.
</p>

<p>
Had the cook, Frenchy, come aboard?
Florence did not know.  She knew that
Tom Dennis was there, among men who
indubitably meant him no good; whether
his would-be assassin had reached Unalaska
in time to join the ship, she knew not.  She
waited, shivering a little, until by degrees
the red side-light vanished.  Presently the
lights showed green and white&mdash;and she
knew that the tide was on the ebb, that the
ship had swung about to her cable.  There
was a light breeze, but strong enough to
carry the brig to sea.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Suddenly a flare lighted up the forward
deck of the whaler.  The voice of Bo'sun Joe
drifted over the water with strange sweetness,
joined by the voices of other men and
interjected by the guttural utterances of
Kanakas trying to keep tune; while the clicking
pawls and the slowly shifting lights betrayed
that the anchor was coming up:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "We cracked it on, on a big skiute,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>To me hoodah, to me hoodah</i>!<br />
  We cracked it on, on a big skiute,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Hurrah for the Black Ball line</i>!<br />
  Blow, my bullies, blow,<br />
  For California oh!<br />
  There's plenty of gold<br />
  As I've been told,<br />
  On the banks of the Sacramento-o!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Meantime, the capstan chantey was being
drowned by other voices&mdash;the steely ring of
Pontifex, the roar of Manuel Mendez, the
shriller tones of Corny and others as orders
were repeated and the topsails were set.  The
confusion of voices became more pronounced.
</p>

<p>
"Hurry up with that royal!" came the
voice of Pontifex.  "Leggo that
lee-brace and trim&mdash;hurry up!"
</p>

<p>
"Aye, sir!"
</p>

<p>
"Head-sails and spanker ready sir," came
the voice of Leman.  "Anchor a-trip!"
</p>

<p>
Then a confused medley of orders:
</p>

<p>
"Brace round them head-yards!
Cat your hook and shake out those
courses! ... Aft with that sheet, now.  Shake
a leg! ... Bo'sun, haul out that bowline!"
</p>

<p>
"Aye, sir!  Haul out the bowline!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  Haul upon the bowline, Kitty lives at Liverpool,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Haul on the bowline, the bowline haul</i>!<br />
  Haul upon the bowline, Kitty lives at Liverpool,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Haul on the bowline, the bowline haul</i>!<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Breathless, Florence watched and listened.
Would Tom succeed without trouble?  Would
the plan, dangerous at best, succeed in
getting little Jerry safe ashore?  The ship's
lights were slowly moving now, moving
toward the entrance of that winding, precipitous
passage.  Captain Pontifex was in charge
himself, for the passage demanded sharp
tacking and skilful handling; his steely
voice carried back across the light wind,
across the silence of the northern night.
Florence strained her eyes into the darkness.
The time was at hand, now.
</p>

<p>
"Ready about!  Down your helm, there!
Hard-a-lee!"  Florence could picture the
big spanker-boom hauled in, the head-sheets
slackening off; the lights showed
that the brig was coming up into the wind,
"Tacks and sheets!  Maintops'l haul!  Round
with them after-yards, there!  Fore-bowline,
let go an' haul!"
</p>

<p>
Not ten minutes were consumed in the
manoeuvre, for the <i>Pelican</i> was smartly
handled.  To the watching Florence,
however, that ten minutes seemed an eternity.
The voices lessened in the distance; the
whaler's lights became tiny glimmering
points as she slowly slid away and was gone.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, down on the surface of the
water, appeared a tiny pin-point&mdash;a flash
of light that was gone instantly.  It flashed
again, and again vanished.  From the
watching girl came a deep breath&mdash;a sigh
of almost agonized relief, as the tension
which was holding her was swiftly relaxed.
</p>

<p>
After this, nothing.  The <i>Pelican</i> was
gone in the winding channel, although
snatches of song drifted back as Bo'sun
Joe led the chanteys that fetched her about
on new tacks.  Over the water lay darkness
and silence; from somewhere back in the
town a tiny phonograph lifted a tinkling
piece of band music into the night.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Florence walked out upon the dock, still
trembling beneath the nervous strain of
those moments.  Five minutes passed&mdash;five
intolerable dragging minutes.  Then
from the water she caught the drip and
splash of muffled oars, and she called out
softly.
</p>

<p>
"All right, ma'am!" came the hoarse
response.  A dim shadow loomed up, and
the voice of the grizzled fisherman continued:
"Thought better not to show no light at
all, ma'am.  Ain't so likely to get questions
asked&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You got him?"
</p>

<p>
"Aye.  Can you give him a hand, ma'am?
The lad's mortal cold&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Florence leaned down and gripped an icy
hand.
</p>

<p>
"Golly, I sure thought my legs was
froze!" came the chattering voice of Jerry.
With all her surprising strength, the girl
heaved; and he came up beside her.  "Scared
stiff, I was!"
</p>

<p>
"They've gone."  Florence turned and
took the horny hand of the fisherman.
"Thank you," she said simply.  "I think
Mr. Dennis wanted me to give you this&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Sho', ma'am, I don't want no money
for that!" protested the other.  But Florence
forced the money upon him, and, with a last
handshake, urged Jerry away toward warmth
and dry clothes.
</p>

<p>
By this time the boy's teeth were chattering
so that talk was impossible.  Upon
reaching her own cottage, where Florence
had already engaged a room for Jerry, she
gave him a spare suit of old clothes which
Dennis had left for him, and left him to
change.
</p>

<p>
"Be quick!" she exclaimed, as she
departed.  "I want to know all about it!"
</p>

<p>
"Y-y-yes, ma'am," chattered Jerry.
</p>

<p>
Ten minutes later, partially warmed and
clad in dry clothes, Jerry, moon-faced and
sheepish, stumbled into the room where
Florence sat beside her immobile father.
The eyes of Captain Miles Hathaway dwelt
upon Jerry.
</p>

<p>
"Come here by the fire."  Florence set
him in a chair beside the oil-stove that
warmed the room.  "Now, tell me!  Did
everything go all right?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes'm, I guess so."  Jerry grinned.
"That is, far's I know it did, for <i>me</i>.  You
see, Mr. Dennis, he told me what to do.
So just 'fore they called all hands, I messed
things up in the galley consid'able, and
the new cook&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The new cook came, then?" interjected
Florence, a little pale.
</p>

<p>
"Yes'm.  Frenchy, they called him.  So
him and the steward tailed on the lines,
with the rest, and the Missus, she was mad
as an ol' cat about the galley bein' messed
up, and so she come to 'tend to it, and I
slipped down into the cabins and met
Mr. Dennis.  He had the stern window open,
and he give me that electric lamp and a
life-buoy what he'd snaked down from the
stern-rail after dark.
</p>

<p>
"So I got the life-belt 'round me an'
clumb out the window and hung on the
line that Mr. Dennis had made fast, and
waited till he give me the word.  Golly,
I was scared!  The skipper, he was right
up there over my head, and he was talkin'
with Frenchy, and he says: 'There's no
call for you to get mad, Dumont.  You
get rid of her husband first like you'd ought
to of done back in Chicago.'  And Frenchy,
he says, 'Where is he?'  The skipper,
he says, 'Down below I guess, but don't
do nothin' now because I figger on sending
him down in a divin'-suit when we get
started to work.'  Then they both laughed,
and just then Mr. Dennis, he give me the
word to swing off&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Had he heard them talking?" demanded
Florence, white-lipped.
</p>

<p>
"Naw.  He didn't know they was talking
up there at all; he'd been standin' back
from the window a piece, I guess.  I was
scared they'd hear him give me the word,
but they didn't.  So I slid down into the
water and the ol' ship walked right away
and nobody seen me.  Tell you what, it
was cold!  I flashed the light a couple o'
times, then the old guy give me a hail
and come alongside and took me in.  Golly,
but I was glad!"
</p>

<p>
Florence sat motionless, a deathly pallor
upon her face.  In the boy's report she
glimpsed utter and horrible destruction of
all the plans which she and Tom Dennis
had built up.  The whole ghastly truth had
flashed upon her, through the words of
Pontifex which Jerry had overheard&mdash;and
which Dennis had not overheard.
</p>

<p>
They would send Tom down in a diving-suit;
and no one could tell what had happened
under the sea in the green depths!
Florence knew that she would not dare to
put through her share of the scheme, after
this.  She might succeed, but only after
Tom Dennis had perished.
</p>

<p>
"Go along to bed, Jerry," she muttered,
her lips white.  The boy looked at her,
and with fear upon his face, rose.  He stumbled
away and was gone.
</p>

<p>
Florence met the motionless dead gaze
of her father.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"You know what it means, father?" she
said, her voice lifeless.  "It means that
they'll murder him!  If I stop here, he'll
be lost!  We can't get the revenue cutter
here before another week, because the
wireless station is closed down&mdash;the operator's
sick.  We found that out this afternoon.
And, father, Tom matters more to me
than&mdash;than anything else!"
</p>

<p>
The eyes of her father slowly moved.  "Yes!"
</p>

<p>
"No time for the phonograph now; I'll
have to give up our whole scheme of
action."  Florence drew a deep breath.  "I'll have
to warn Tom, father; the only way to warn
him will be to follow the <i>Pelican</i> and&mdash;and
do it openly.  I know where the wreck lies.
</p>

<p>
"That fisherman who brought in
Jerry&mdash;I know where he lives.  His boat has a
motor, and he says he often cruises among
the islands.  I think he'll take me.  Anyway,
there's no larger boat here than his.  I must
see him to-night, at once, and arrange to get
off in the morning.  I'll see the authorities,
explain about the phonograph, and
you can tell them all about it while I'm
gone.  Perhaps they can get help to us.  If
that fisherman will take me, maybe we can
get Tom away before&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She broke into low sobs.  She could see
only disaster ahead&mdash;and duty to the man
whom she loved.  Suddenly she leaned
forward, caught her father's lifeless hand.
</p>

<p>
"Father!  You know all about this place,
and everything!  Tell me!  Is there anything
else I can do?  If there is, I'll get out the
phonograph now.  Is there?"
</p>

<p>
Slowly the lids of Miles Hathaway moved
twice.  "No."
</p>

<p>
"And you think I'm right to go?  It's
the only thing to do?  We'll lose everything,
for Pontifex will loot the wreck and be gone
before we could get back here and have the
cutter after him.  But isn't it the only thing
to do?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said the eyes of Miles Hathaway.

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br /><br />
THE WRECK
</h3>

<p>
From Unalaska to the position indicated
upon the chart as the resting-place of the
<i>John Simpson</i> was, in the rough, six hundred
knots&mdash;nearly seven hundred miles.
</p>

<p>
When Tom Dennis wakened, the morning
after the <i>Pelican</i> tacked out of the Unalaska
channel, he found that she had, with the
audacity of all whaling ships, run through
Unimak Pass in the dark and was now tearing
across the North Pacific at an eight-knot
clip, with a stiff south-easter rolling her
along bravely.
</p>

<p>
Dennis realized full well that he must
avoid all appearance of suspicions having
been awakened in him.  When at breakfast
Mrs. Pontifex remarked upon the blessed
relief of having the cook aboard, Dennis
quite ignored the subject therefore, conscious
that Ericksen was watching him with keen
and predatory gaze.
</p>

<p>
"And when shall we make that position,
Skipper?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Pontifex shrugged.  "If this breeze holds,
it's a three-day run for us.  Barring a dead
calm, we'll be on the spot&mdash;let's see, this is
Saturday; we'll be on the spot Tuesday
morning without fail.  Eh, Mr. Leman?"
</p>

<p>
"Easy, sir.  Had we better overhaul
that diving-tackle, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Break it out to-day.  Bo'sun Joe,
rig up a derrick for'ard to-day; chances are
we'll be able to lay close enough to the wreck
to swing the stuff directly aboard, and we'll
not want to waste time.  A south-easter might
lay us up on those islands.  Ever been diving,
Mr. Dennis?"
</p>

<p>
Dennis nodded.  "Twice.  Never at sea,
but in Lake Michigan."
</p>

<p>
"Then we'll have a new sensation for you,
if you like."  Pontifex smiled cruelly.
</p>

<p>
"Bo'sun Joe and I are the only ones aboard
with any experience, and if you care to take
a shift with us, we'll be glad."
</p>

<p>
"I'm in for anything that'll make me
useful," said Dennis.  "You think the
wreck is still on the rocks where we can
reach it, then?"
</p>

<p>
"We're gambling on it," returned Pontifex curtly.
</p>

<p>
The wind held, and the old whaler blew
down the miles of westering with every stitch
of canvas taut as a drumhead.  That afternoon
Tom Dennis got a good straight look
at the new cook&mdash;a most disreputable little
man, dirty and slouchy in the extreme.
Gone were the trim mustachios, gone was all
the natty air; but the man was the same who
had spilled a vial of chloroform in the
Chicago room of Tom Dennis.  There was no
doubt about it.
</p>

<p>
Dennis, however, said nothing; later,
when Corny introduced the cook as Frenchy,
he shook hands and was very pleasant, and
if Dumont suspected anything, his suspicions
were set at rest by Dennis' air of careless
non-interest.
</p>

<p>
Upon the following day the brigantine was
still tearing along with a swirl of water
hissing under her counter.  Off to the north the
islands showed their mountain-tips against
the sky, blue and continuous as some distant
mainland.  Talking with the mates and
boat-steerers and Kanakas, Tom Dennis was
entertained with many stories of those islands:
how fox- and seal-farmers were scattered
through the group; how small launches
cruised the entire length of the island chain
with impunity; how in time to come there
would be a thriving island population where
now were empty stretches of land or scattered
communities of miserable natives.
</p>

<p>
And there were other and more ominous
tales: tales of Boguslav and Katmai, of
islands that came and went overnight, of
oil-soaked whalers caught under descending
showers of hot ash and burned to the water's
edge.  There were tales of seal-poaching, of
poachers who fought each other, of Yankees
who fought Japs; and these tales verged upon
the personal.  Nods and winks were
interchanged when Bo'sun Joe told about "men
he had known", or when black Manuel
Mendez related exploits of which "he had
heard".  Tom Dennis gained some fine
material for feature-stories&mdash;but it worried
him.  He began to realize that these men
among whom he had fallen were, so far as
their natures were concerned, no better than
pirates.
</p>

<p>
Then, upon the evening of the second day,
came the affair which proved that all restraint
was now loosed.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Darkness was falling, and having no particular
longing for the society of the Missus and
Pontifex, in the stern cabin, Dennis was in
the waist near the try-works, listening while
Corny spun a whaling yarn to the watch.
The yarn was broken into by a sudden
choking cry, followed by an excited call in
Portuguese.  The voice was that of Manuel
Mendez who would take the deck from
Mr. Leman in a few moments.
</p>

<p>
At sound of the cry, Corny whipped out
his knife and was gone like a shadow.  Dennis
was the first to follow, darting after the black
boat-steerer toward the windward side of
the deck, whence the voice had come.
</p>

<p>
An instant later, Dennis had turned the
corner of the try-works.  What had happened
he could not tell; but he saw the huge figure
of Manuel Mendez hanging to the mizzen-shrouds,
groaning faintly.  Close by, the
insignificant little cook was facing the
glittering knife of Corny&mdash;facing it with bare
hands.
</p>

<p>
Corny, growling savage Cape Verde oaths,
leaped.  Swift as light was Frenchy, darting
in and out again, sweeping the knife aside,
striking catlike.  Corny staggered back.
</p>

<p>
At that instant Mr. Leman swept upon
the scene, his grey wisps of hair flying,
his long arms flailing.  Frenchy, not hearing
him, was knocked headlong into the galley
and fell with a tremendous crashing of pots
and pans.
</p>

<p>
"He keel Manuel!" cried out Corny,
retreating from the second mate and putting
up his knife.  "He mos' get my eyes&mdash;ah,
de poor Manuel!"
</p>

<p>
The giant figure of the bearded black fell
limply.  Dennis retreated, feeling sick; for
Manuel Mendez had been stabbed with his
own knife&mdash;after his eyes had been gouged
away.  Even for sea-fighting, there was
something horrible about it.
</p>

<p>
Later, Dennis came upon the steward and
two of the miserable white sailors talking
near the forecastle scuttle.  The steward was
describing what had happened.
</p>

<p>
"Joked 'im, the mate did; chaffed 'im
abaht some woman.  Bli' me!  Frenchy
was hup and at 'im like this."  And the
Cockney held the two first fingers of his
right hand forked and aloft.  "Tried to jerk
at 'is knife, 'e did, but Frenchy hup an'
took if first&mdash;ugh!  'Orrible it was.  And now
the Capting, 'e'll 'ang Frenchy."
</p>

<p>
Somebody guffawed in the darkness.
</p>

<p>
"Hang Frenchy?  Not him!  Frenchy an'
the Skipper have sailed together for years,
they tell me.  Hey, mates?"
</p>

<p>
"You bet," came a response.  "Skipper don'
dast hang <i>him</i>, I guess."
</p>

<p>
To Dennis it was rankly incredible; but
it was true.  In the morning Manuel Mendez,
who would smile no more his white-toothed
hungry smile, was sent overside with a chunk
of coal sewed at his feet; and as the body was
committed to the deep, Frenchy leaped to
the rail and sent a bucket of slush over the
canvas.  An old whaling custom, this, to
keep the dead man's ghost from following the
ship.  But Frenchy remained untouched
for his crime.  If there were any inquiry or
punishment, Dennis never heard of it.  The
ship's routine pursued its usual course,
Ericksen being advanced to the position of
second mate, Leman to that of first mate.
</p>

<p>
One man aboard, however, did not forget
the happening; and this was Corny, the
compatriot of the murdered mate.  More than
once, Dennis saw Corny's eyes follow Frenchy
about the deck with a black, murderous look.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
These things, however, swiftly were
forgotten in the rumoured vicinity of the wreck;
and since everyone aboard either knew, or
had guessed, the import of this strange cruise,
the ship hummed like a beehive with speculation
and gossip.  At noon, with the remarkable
keenness which distinguishes whaling
skippers, Captain Pontifex completed his
observations and then laid out a new course,
stating that it would bring them under the
lee of the island at four bells in the morning
watch, at which time the brigantine was to be
hove to and await daylight.
</p>

<p>
Tom Dennis was the only one aboard,
except Captain Pontifex and the Missus
who did not sleep by watches.  At dinner
that night the skipper broached a bottle of
wine, and sent forward a tot of grog for all
hands; suppressed excitement ruled the
ship, even the gentle Kanakas breaking into
wild native songs until suppressed by the
Skipper's order.  After an evening of much
talk, mainly about the various methods
of raising sunken treasure, Dennis turned in.
</p>

<p>
With the morning came disenchantment.
Dennis had dreamed of gold-mad sailors, of
wild haste, of everything forgotten save the
proximity of sudden riches.  But once on
deck he found things very different.  The
<i>Pelican</i> was standing across the end of a
barren rocky island; just beyond and ahead
of her was a long scooped-out depression in
the rocky shore, and in the centre of this
depression lay the wreck of the <i>Simpson</i>.
The seamen were attending strictly to their
positions and duties; there was no hilarious
ring of voices, and everything was about as
romantic as a visit to a coaling-station.
</p>

<p>
But the <i>John Simpson</i> was there&mdash;no
doubt about it!
</p>

<p>
Her stern, apparently wedged in among a
nest of rocks, stood up at a sharp angle,
the deck not quite awash but running down
into the water swiftly.  The aftermast stood
a broken stump.  At some distance showed
the foremast, likewise broken.  Dennis turned
to Pontifex and the Missus who stood beside
him.
</p>

<p>
"That foremast seems a long distance
away," he said.  "Doesn't look natural."
</p>

<p>
"Broke in two," vouchsafed the Missus
curtly.  Pontifex nodded.
</p>

<p>
"That's it," he stated with conviction.
"Fore part lays in deep water&mdash;eight or ten
fathom, probably.  Look at her stern.  See
the water a-drip?  She's well covered at high
tide: just now the tide's out.  No wonder she
broke!"
</p>

<p>
"Looks as if we'd anchor right close to her
fore-hatch," said the Missus.
</p>

<p>
Ericksen, with a whaleboat and hand-line,
was engaged in taking soundings of the
position.  Suddenly a savage exclamation
escaped Pontifex who had been scrutinizing
the visible stern of the wreck through a pair
of binoculars.
</p>

<p>
"Take charge, Mr. Leman," snapped the
skipper, then lifted his voice.  "Corny!
Lower away&mdash;four hands will be enough to
row us in.  Come on, Mr. Dennis!"
</p>

<p>
As Corny's crew leaped to the falls of a
forward boat, Pontifex strode forward, his
thin face murderous.  Dennis followed him
in amazement.
</p>

<p>
"What's the trouble, Skipper?"
</p>

<p>
"Come on," responded Pontifex snarlingly.
"I'm not sure yet&mdash;but if it's true&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Seeing that the Skipper was in no mood
for questions, Dennis said nothing further
but followed into the whaleboat.  Four
Kanakas gave way at the long oars, and the
boat began to slide landward.  Pontifex
studied the wreck through his binoculars a
moment, then handed the glasses to Dennis.
</p>

<p>
"Look at it&mdash;on the mainmast!"
</p>

<p>
Puzzled, Dennis focused on the stump of
the mainmast.  High up, so high as to be
well beyond reach, he discerned a small
object; it looked like a bit of board nailed
to the mast.
</p>

<p>
"Is that writing on it?" he exclaimed,
lowering the glasses.
</p>

<p>
Pontifex nodded sourly.  "Probably.  We'll
soon see."
</p>

<p>
Boatswain Joe's boat, which had finished
its survey and was heading for the ship,
passed within hail.  Pontifex transmitted
word to Mr. Leman by Ericksen, ordering
the <i>Pelican</i> laid as close alongside the
fore-hatch of the wreck as the depth would allow.
Bo'sun Joe reported that the fore-part of
the <i>Simpson</i> lay in nine fathoms, with fair
holding-ground for the anchors, and that the
whaler could crowd alongside her easily.
</p>

<p>
As their boat drew in, Tom Dennis could
see that the stern of the wreck must indeed
be completely submerged at low tide; this
was attested by the barnacles and weedy
growths covering the rails and decking.  But
it was the square bit of plank nailed to the
mast which drew his gaze and that of the
Skipper.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" cried Pontifex, with a furious oath.
"Look at that, Dennis!  A painted sign!"
</p>

<p>
Taking the glasses, Dennis could indeed
make out that the board appeared to bear
words or characters&mdash;and to his eye they were
Japanese.  At this query, the skipper swore
again.
</p>

<p>
"Aye, the yellow scum!  They swarm
around the islands, raiding fox-farms and
poaching or trading according as they dare.
One of their boats happened along here, blast
the luck, and saw the wreck; posted a sign to
warn off their own countrymen, and went
for help.  They came at high water and didn't
wait for ebb tide.  Notice where that sign is,
up there?  Way enough, Corny; we don't
want to board her."
</p>

<p>
The boat swung around on idle oars,
twenty feet from the rocks that held the stern
of the <i>Simpson</i>.  Dennis scrutinized the board
carefully, then handed the glasses to Pontifex.
</p>

<p>
"It's tough luck, Skipper," he said quietly.
"To think that she lay here undiscovered for
over two years, then was found only a week
or so before we came!"
</p>

<p>
"A week?"  Pontifex stared at him with
flaming eyes.  "How d'ye know that?"
</p>

<p>
"Focus up on those nail-heads in that
board.  They're rusty, of course, but the
rust hasn't gone into the wood around
them&mdash;see?  And the black paint on the board
looks pretty glossy when the sunlight catches
it right."
</p>

<p>
"Right you are!" commented the Skipper
with a growl.
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to do about it?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Do</i> about it!" Pontifex looked venomous.
"Fight, by the lord Harry!  This is salvage.
Whoever can hold hardest, gets.  Let me get
the old brig anchored in here, and I'd like to
see any dirty yellow poachers pry my fingers
loose!"
</p>

<p>
Dennis remembered the big gun-rack in
the cabin, and said no more.  Rifles can be
used for other purposes than killing seals and
bears.
</p>

<p>
"We'll be all snug by breakfast-time,"
added Pontifex, watching the <i>Pelican</i> come
slowly in as her top canvas fluttered down.
"Then we'll set to work <i>pronto</i>.  We don't
want a gale to catch us here, either.  More
likely to catch fog, anyway."
</p>

<p>
And the skipper made good his words.
Before seven bells were struck at 7.20 that
morning* the <i>Pelican</i> was berthed alongside
the fore half of the <i>Simpson</i> and all was made
snug below and aloft.  Captain Pontifex called
all hands and made an address.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Usually struck at this time so the relieving watch may
breakfast first.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"The Japs have been here, and they'll be
back," he said curtly.  "There's salvage
money ahead of everybody, men, so we're
going to pitch in and work day and night,
watch and watch.  The day watches will
devote themselves to getting the stuff aboard,
because a diver can't remain down very long
in this water: all hands will have a chance at
going down.  The night watches will stow
the stuff below and make a clear deck before
morning.
</p>

<p>
"While we're lying here, we'll redistribute
the watches.  Mr. Leman and Mr. Ericksen
will take the port watch, I'll take the
starboard watch with Mr. Dennis and Corny.
One man from each watch will be set ashore&mdash;that
high point of rock makes a better lookout
perch than the crosstrees&mdash;to watch for the
approach of any craft whatever.  And mark
this, men!  If you don't report back to the
beach when the watches are changed, I'll
come ashore and hunt you down with a shotgun!
That's all.  The starboard watch will
keep the deck."
</p>

<p>
Did the port watch go below?  Not yet!
Breakfast was a formality, a hurriedly bolted
affair; ten minutes later one of the four white
seamen was set ashore as lookout, and the
Skipper fell to work.
</p>

<p>
"You'll mind the pumps my watch, my
dear," said Pontifex to the Missus.  "When
I'm down, I'll trust nobody else to watch my
air supply.  Do you want to go down, Mr. Dennis?"
</p>

<p>
"You bet," and Dennis laughed.  "I'd
like nothing better!"
</p>

<p>
A complete double set of diving apparatus
was already awaiting them.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br /><br />
THE ENEMY COMES
</h3>

<p>
The water was cold&mdash;cold and clear and
biting as ice.  To Dennis, inside the rubber
suit, it seemed as though he had been
plunged bodily into liquid ice.  Through
the thick glass of the helmet he could see
the green translucence all around him, clear
and empty and shimmering with the sunlight
from above.  For himself, as for the
other green hands at the work, he knew
that a long submersion would be impossible.
</p>

<p>
Darker grew the water underfoot as the
light from above was diffused to the greater
depths.  Dennis had gone down from the
quarter-deck of the <i>Pelican</i>; this, according
to the soundings, would bring him to the
sea-floor at the after end of the front half
of the wreck.  He could thus see whether
the contents of the <i>Simpson's</i> main-hold,
aft of which she had broken in two, lay
piled upon the sea-floor between the two
sections of the wreck.  If so, the work of
salvage would be greatly hastened.  Pontifex,
in the meantime, was exploring the bows
and fore hatch of the wreck.
</p>

<p>
Down went Tom Dennis into the depths,
in a seemingly interminable descent.
Suddenly a huge shadowy black mass seemed
rushing at him from below, and swift terror
sent his heart throbbing; for he felt very
helpless.  Then he remembered&mdash;the wreck,
of course!  The regular "click-click" of the
pumps, sounding down through his air-valves,
reassured and heartened him.  An
instant later he stood upon the bottom.
</p>

<p>
He wondered that there was very little
growth or algae to obstruct him, until
he realized that what little algae he could
see were bending far over in the grip of
a fairly strong sub-surface current, which,
combined with the intense coldness of the
water, had a discouraging effect upon marine
growths.  The bottom was not smooth,
however, being extremely rocky and uneven.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Simpson</i> had apparently broken just
abaft the engine-room, and the fore half
lay with her sloping deck toward the shore.
Dennis had come to the bottom close to
her keel, and he was no long time in
discovering that spilled over the sea bottom
lay almost enough cargo to fill up the <i>Pelican</i>.
</p>

<p>
Having brought a line ready prepared,
Dennis got the bight around a packing-case
plastered with barnacles.  As he was
drawing it taut, came a jerk upon his
lifeline&mdash;the signal that his agreed "stint" was
up.  Having no wish to be crippled or laid
on the sick list, Dennis responded, and at
once was hauled off the bottom.
</p>

<p>
His ascent was very slow, and of necessity;
for a quick jerk up from the depths would
ruin any man alive.  The progression had
to be gradual and halting.
</p>

<p>
On the way up, it occurred to him for
the first time that he was literally in the
hands of his enemies!
</p>

<p>
The moment he was in the morning sunlight
again, Tom Dennis forgot his uneasiness
and laughed at the terror which had seized
upon him in the depths.  It was absurd.
</p>

<p>
He did not go down again that morning,
however.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Dennis was nearly clear of his diving-suit
before the Skipper's copper helmet
broke the water amidships.  Pontifex reported
that the bow plates of the wreck were torn
out, and he had lined two cases; these
were brought in, together with that which
Dennis had secured, and were at once
smashed open.  The two cases from the fore
hold proved to contain ammunition; that
from the main hold, two excellently packed
machine-guns.
</p>

<p>
This was enough for Pontifex, who at
once conjectured that the main and after
holds of the <i>Simpson</i> had contained the
bulk of the machine-guns, the most valuable
part of her cargo.  Corny at once broke out
a kedge, lowered it to the stern of his boat
and hung it there by a stop to the ring,
then started off to the stern of the <i>Simpson</i>.
Once laid among the rocks in the shallower
water there, the crew tramped around the
capstan while Bo's'n Joe lifted "Windy
weather!  Stormy weather!" into a
resounding chorus.
</p>

<p>
At last it was done.  The <i>Pelican</i>, all
reconnaissance over, lay snugly ensconced
between the two sections of the <i>John Simpson</i>.
The off watch went below, curiosity appeased
by the barnacled unromantic packing-cases;
and Captain Pontifex fell to hard work,
going down again almost at once.
</p>

<p>
Dennis took charge of the after pumps,
while the Missus herself took the wheel of
those in the waist.  The Kanakas, only
prevented from diving naked by the depth and
the icy coldness of the water, were eager
to try the diving-suits.  As each man went
down in turn, he carried four lines, making
them fast to as many cases.  Thus, despite
the brief diving spells, in no long time
the cases began to come aboard as fast as
they could be handled.
</p>

<p>
When the watch knocked off at eight
bells, noon, Dennis was amazed by the
number of cases which had come aboard.
He was dead tired, also; the constant strain
of watching the pump gauges and keeping
the air at exactly the right pressure was
no light one, and at odd moments he had
tailed on to the lines with the other men.
</p>

<p>
"I see you're no greenhorn," commented
Pontifex at dinner, with a sharp glance at
the hands of Dennis.  "Where'd you learn
to keep your thumb clear while hauling
a line?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I've knocked around ships a little,"
Dennis laughed.  "Are you going to stay in
this position?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  If the Japs come, we're fixed to
keep 'em off both ends of the wreck.  Well,
think you can go down again this afternoon?"
</p>

<p>
Dennis nodded.  "Sure!  I'm supposed
to have a bad heart, but I haven't noticed
it."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
As it chanced, however, he did not go
down again that day, for during Mr. Leman's
watch the after airhose developed a leak
which had to be fixed, and the second
apparatus was consequently out of business until
the following morning.  Pontifex, who took
the first dog-watch, kept the one suit hard
at work, and all aboard were well
satisfied with results.
</p>

<p>
That night, by the light of a huge flare set
atop the try-works, the cargo was stowed.
Shears had to be run up over the hatchways
to handle the heavy cases, and the deck
was not washed down until just before the
morning watch.  When Dennis came on
deck at 4 a.m. the ship was incased in
so heavy a fog that the lookout was
withdrawn from the island.
</p>

<p>
"Dis fog, maybe she keep up a week,"
grumbled Corny, overhauling the diving
lines.  "If de Jap sheep come, den look
out!"
</p>

<p>
The stern of the wreck, which had been
hidden at high tide, was again being
uncovered.  So thick was the fog that Dennis
doubted the possibility of diving, but his
doubts were soon set at rest.  Corny and
the skipper, each carrying lines, made a
descent, and Corny returned with word that
it was a "cinch".
</p>

<p>
Pontifex was still down, and Dennis was
preparing to get into the suit as Corny
vacated it, when of a sudden the voice of
the Missus bit out from the waist.
</p>

<p>
"Keep quiet, all hands!  Listen!"
</p>

<p>
Astonished, Dennis obeyed.  Corny, beside
him, stood with hand cupped to ear, slowly
shaking his head.  Nothing was to be heard,
The fog was impenetrable.
</p>

<p>
"What did she hear?" murmured Dennis.
The Cape Verde man shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"No telling.  But nobody don't fool
<i>her</i>&mdash;ah!  Listen, queek!"
</p>

<p>
Dennis heard it then&mdash;an indistinct and
muffled vibration, too slight to be called
a noise, which was felt rather than heard.
It came again and again, an irregular sound.
</p>

<p>
"It's de sail," said Corny.  "De sail
flap-flap in de wind&mdash;and dere's somet'ing
else goin', too&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"A boat's engine!" exclaimed Dennis softly.
</p>

<p>
"Yeou, Corny!"  The Missus gave swift
command aft.  "Call all hands aft an' tell
Mr. Leman to fetch the rifles.  Lively yeou!"
</p>

<p>
Meantime, she was bringing Pontifex
aboard, manifestly against his will, as the
signal-line testified.  Dennis kicked out of
the rubber suit, getting clear just as Bo's'n
Joe came up the companion way.  A moment
later both Leman and Corny appeared,
each with an armload of rifles interspersed
with shot-guns.
</p>

<p>
"Strike me blind!" exclaimed Ericksen,
pausing beside Dennis, and listening intently.
"If it ain't them Japs&mdash;a schooner, likely,
beatin' up for the island under power, and
all hands too lazy to take in sail!  Aye,
that's them."
</p>

<p>
"But it may be someone else," said
Dennis.  "A fisherman, perhaps."
</p>

<p>
Bo's'n Joe gave him a look of pitying
scorn from his uptwisted eye.  "You wait
an' see!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Rifles were served out to all aboard,
Dennis among the rest, and by the time
Captain Pontifex was up and out of his
suit, the ship was ready for defence.  Pontifex
heard the news without comment; a rifle
under his arm, he dispatched Corny to the
crosstrees to keep watch from there, and
ordered Mr. Leman to stand by with a
megaphone.
</p>

<p>
"Growin' closer, sir," volunteered Ericksen.
"Takin' soundings, she is."
</p>

<p>
The skipper nodded.  The fog-muffled
thrum of an engine was now distinctly
perceptible, while the slatting of sails told
that the approaching craft was not far
off.  The fog was thick and steady without
a breath of wind to thin it out.
</p>

<p>
"All right, Mr. Leman," said Pontifex
suddenly.  "Let 'em have it."
</p>

<p>
Instantly the stentorian tones of Mr. Leman,
intensified a thousandfold by the
megaphone, blared out upon the fog.
</p>

<p>
"Stand off or ye'll run us down, ye lubbers!
Keep away!"
</p>

<p>
From the mist came a shrill thin yell
of surprise, followed by an excited jabbering
of many tongues.  Clearly the visitors were of
foreign origin.  Then a shrill voice lifted
in English amid sudden silence as the
thrumming motor ceased its noise.
</p>

<p>
"'Ello!  Oo are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Very good, Bo's'n Joe," said the skipper
calmly.  "She'll be in the centre of the
fairway, most likely&mdash;about two points abaft
our beam."
</p>

<p>
Ericksen lifted to his shoulder the shotgun
with which he had armed himself, and
two smashing reports blasted into the fog
as he fired both barrels.  A shrill clamour
of voices made answer, followed by instantaneous
and blanket-like silence.  Then came
a single sullen plunge, as of some heavy
object striking the water.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" remarked Pontifex, staring into
into the fog as though he could see through
it.  "Very good, Bo's'n&mdash;you reached 'em.
They've anchored, and they'll lie doggo
until the fog lifts.  They know we'll waste
no bullets if we can't see them."
</p>

<p>
"Reached them?" repeated Dennis.  "You
don't mean that Ericksen tried to hit them?"
</p>

<p>
Bo's'n Joe guffawed, and Pontifex gave
Dennis a peculiar smiling look&mdash;a very
diabolical look.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Mr. Dennis, that's exactly
what he did.  And some yellow beggar
caught the pellets in his hide&mdash;in other
words, got the hint!  They'll try no games
until they can see what they're up against."
</p>

<p>
"But where are they?" demanded Dennis,
giving up any expostulation.
</p>

<p>
"About six fathoms away, I should say&mdash;not
more than fifty feet, certainly."  The
skipper glanced at Mr. Leman, who nodded
confirmation.  "They might be less than
that, and we couldn't see them, nor they
us.  After the fog lifts&mdash;well, then there'll
be fun!"
</p>

<p>
"They'll fight?"
</p>

<p>
Pontifex caressed his moustache and smiled
softly.
</p>

<p>
"More or less&mdash;they'll try some deviltry
on us first.  Lay out some harpoons and
shoulder-guns, Mr. Leman; we'll have a
few tonite bombs ready.  Corny, bring
in those cases that I lined before I came
up.  We'll get back to work directly."
</p>

<p>
Dennis saw no good in making protests.
There was no law here save that of the
strongest, and Pontifex was dead right in
carrying the fight to the enemy, aggression
being nine points of fighting law.  Besides,
Pontifex was manifestly enjoying the prospect,
and just at present Dennis was playing
a waiting game and had no desire to bring
about any crisis.
</p>

<p>
There being no time for more workman-like
methods, an anvil and a cold-chisel
were brought aft, with half a dozen harpoons,
and two of the hands were set to work cutting
through the iron harpoon hafts, just behind
the spear-points.  Now, modern whaling
is carried out almost exactly as the New
Bedford whalers did it a century ago, except
for a small brass cylinder fastened to the
haft of the harpoon.  In this cylinder is
carried a tonite bomb.  Whether the harpoon
be flung by hand or be fired from a
shoulder-gun, it carries the bomb into the
whale&mdash;and that ends the whale.
</p>

<p>
The points off the six harpoons, Mr. Leman
made ready a couple of shoulder-guns
and loaded the cylinders of the harpoons
with bombs.  As he observed, they might
or they might not do much damage, but
they would make a big noise when they
hit; and with this intent the weapons
were laid aside to be used in case of any
aggressiveness on the part of the enemy.
For the present, at least, the Japs seemed
to be maintaining a careful silence.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Mr. Dennis," said Pontifex at
length, "I'm going to resume my interrupted
job; I guess I can lay a few more
lines before quitting.  Who's going down
on your lines?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, I will&mdash;if you think it's safe,"
returned Dennis.  "You're not going to
knock off work, then?"
</p>

<p>
"On account of that yellow scum?  I
should say not!" exclaimed Pontifex.
"Mr. Leman will do any fighting that's necessary
while I'm down; and the Missus will see
to it that nothing fouls our lines.  But
send someone else if you don't like the
idea."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it suits me," answered Dennis,
knocking out his pipe.  "I dare say there's
no great risk, but it would feel sweet if
the ship left us prowling on the bottom, eh?"
</p>

<p>
Pontifex grunted and went forward, being
swallowed up in the fog that cloaked everything.
</p>

<p>
Having learned from Corny that the bottom
was pretty dark, but by no means unsuited
to working, Dennis called the steward.
Although the little Cockney was a viperous
criminal ashore, he was a faithful soul at
sea, and Dennis had learned that he
entertained a strong feeling of responsibility
while watching the pumps.
</p>

<p>
"Hi, steward!" he called.  "Come and
give me a hand with this suit&mdash;and bring
a couple of Kanakas to run these pumps,
too.  Corny's busy with the lines."
</p>

<p>
"Comin' sir," said the steward's voice,
and the Cockney appeared a moment
later.
</p>

<p>
Meantime, in the waist, Captain Pontifex
was engaged in talk with the cook,
while the Missus listened.
</p>

<p>
"Now's the time, Dumont," said Pontifex,
fondling his curled mustache.  "Work
right along aft until you get on his line,
savvy?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mais oui</i>!" returned Frenchy, his black
eyes glittering.  "But me, I like not this
<i>diable</i> of a fog!  It will be dark under the
water."
</p>

<p>
"So much the better."  And Pontifex
smiled his cruel smile.  "So much the better!
He thinks I'm going down.  Let the steward
attend to his pumps&mdash;and we'll blame the
steward for what happens.  In this murky
water he'll not see you coming down
there&mdash;you can get on top of him and cut his
lines and be off in a shot.  Are you ready or
not?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes!" exclaimed Frenchy, reaching for
the diving-suit.
</p>

<p>
"And watch out for the tide," cautioned
the skipper.  "It's ebbing strong and you
might lose your bearings if you don't look
sharp."
</p>

<p>
Frenchy grinned, and unstrapped his
sheath-knife.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br /><br />
IN THE DEPTHS
</h3>

<p>
As the steward helped pull up the rubber
dress about the body of Dennis, he spoke
in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
"Beg pardon, sir, but hit looks like you
'ad lost your knife."
</p>

<p>
Dennis glanced down at the deck where
his paraphernalia lay.  The belt and sheath
were there; but the large knife, a regular part
of every diver's equipment, was missing.
</p>

<p>
"That's queer!" he said slowly.  "Hm!
Probably Corny lost the knife and didn't
notice it.  Better get me one from the galley,
steward: it'll take a carving knife to fit that
big sheath."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."  The steward slipped off into
the mist.  The two Kanakas stood at the
pump-wheels, shivering in the mist and talking
together.
</p>

<p>
A moment later the steward reappeared,
carrying a long, keenly edged carving knife.
He tried it in the sheath, and it fitted well
enough.
</p>

<p>
"Werry good, sir.  All set!"
</p>

<p>
Dennis liked the little Cockney&mdash;he liked
the man's thorough responsibility in his
job of watching the pumps.  But now, as
he helped adjust the back and breast-pieces,
and buckled the belt about his waist, he
felt once more that in this work he was putting
himself in the power of his enemies.
</p>

<p>
He forced a laugh at the idea; yet it took a
supreme effort to conquer his imagination.
They did not want to kill him, of course&mdash;but
if they did, how easy in this fog!  But
that was all nonsense.  There was no question
of murdering.  The very notion was folly!
</p>

<p>
Dennis helped the steward adjust the big
copper helmet, and the Cockney screwed it
fast into the neck-plate.  A moment later,
Dennis was climbing over the rail.  The usual
diver's shot-line would carry him straight
down, and besides this, a ladder had been
slung over the stern to assist in the ascent.
The steward gave him the four lines, attached
to the rail at intervals which would prevent
their fouling after being attached to the
cases, and Dennis slipped down into the
depths.
</p>

<p>
As always, the steady and regular clicking
of the pumps sounded through his air
valves with reassuring effect.  Captain
Pontifex had not provided very up-to-date
outfits, with telephones and electric lights and
other frills&mdash;for this reason no diving work
could be done at night.  The suits were good
and dependable, however, lacking only gloves
to make them well adapted to this icy water.
</p>

<p>
Dennis resolutely dismissed all thoughts
of possible danger, and concentrated his
attention upon the work in hand.
</p>

<p>
As Corny had reported, the water down
below was clear enough for work, but the
lack of filtering sunlight made it gloomy,
grey, and obscure in details.  When at last
Dennis felt his feet touch the bottom, he
was forced to stand for a moment and adjust
his eyesight to the altered conditions.
Presently he was enabled to descry objects, and
he moved toward the scattered and far-strewn
heaps of boxes which lay between the two
sections of the <i>John Simpson</i>.
</p>

<p>
Dennis could see nothing of Pontifex
at work below, but in the present obscurity
that was not strange.  Besides, the divers,
from waist and stern of the <i>Pelican</i>, kept as
far apart as possible for fear of the lines
fouling.
</p>

<p>
Now, as he advanced, Dennis thought
that he perceived a dimly moving shape off
to his left to seaward; but it vanished
almost instantly.  It might have been some
fish, he concluded, or a bunch of drifting
algae.  It was now hard upon noon, and the
tide was fast on the ebb.
</p>

<p>
With the strange buoyancy which comes
to the diver on the bottom, Dennis took
leaps, one after the other, with a boyish
delight.  He cleared no ground this way,
however, and soon returned to the slow
progress afoot; there was too much danger of
losing his balance and burying his helmet in
the ooze as he came down.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Presently he came to an upright crowbar
in a heap of boxes, which Corny had been
using to pry loose each case in order to pass
the bight of a line around it.  Dennis found
two loose boxes and made fast two of his
lines; but without tying himself to the pile,
he could not use the crowbar&mdash;his own
buoyancy was too great.  So, to save time,
he passed on to some scattered cases
ahead.
</p>

<p>
At this juncture, his remaining two lines
fouled about his dragging air hose.  When
at length he got them extricated and clear,
he had great difficulty in maintaining his
balance against the set of the tide.  But
at length he got the first line fast to a box,
and with the second line he secured another.
</p>

<p>
As he straightened up and grasped his
safety-line to signal the steward that he was
ready to ascend, he observed a great shadowy
mass in the water ahead.  Accustomed to the
gloom by this time, he perceived that the
mass was the after-end of the <i>John Simpson</i>,
reaching up through the water on a sharp
incline.
</p>

<p>
He tugged at his line.  To his amazement
he felt no resistance whatever.  He tugged
harder, more sharply&mdash;and the line coiled
snakily toward him.  At the same instant
he heard a sharp click behind his ear; the
safety valve in his helmet had snapped shut.
His air-tight hose and his line had been
parted!
</p>

<p>
In this supreme moment, when he faced
inescapable death, Tom Dennis felt none
of his previous fear.  His brain worked like a
clock.
</p>

<p>
He knew that either from the stern above,
or from the water beneath he had been cut
off and left to die.  He had been too
slow&mdash;he had failed to heed his inward premonitions.
And the sheer horror of it was that he would
not die for a comparatively long time.  There
was sufficient air in his helmet and in the
bellying folds of his rubber suit to sustain
life for several minutes!
</p>

<p>
What good would this do him?  None!
What good would it do him to reach the line
he had made fast to boxes?  None.  This was
no accident.  The ends of his lines told him
that they had been cut clean, severed.
Those above would disregard any possible
signals, would let him perish miserably.
He could depend upon no one.  He was
trapped, helpless, murdered!
</p>

<p>
Then suddenly, Dennis perceived
something in the water behind him.  He
turned.
</p>

<p>
Not a dozen feet distant, another diver
stood there, helmet turned toward him
watching.  Through the thick glass Dennis
glimpsed keen dark eyes, a gleam of white
teeth; this was not Pontifex at all.
Recognition came to him, and a thin cry escaped his
lips&mdash;Dumont!  Here was the murderer!
</p>

<p>
Dennis gripped his knife, half-minded
to retaliate upon this assassin who had cut
his lines; for in the man's hand he dimly
caught the glitter of steel.  But, as Dennis
tensed himself for the leap, he checked
the movement&mdash;another dim figure had
appeared!
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Amazement held Dennis spellbound,
incredulous.  There had been but two diving-suits
aboard the <i>Pelican</i>; of this he was quite
certain.  Yet here upon the sea floor stood
three divers!
</p>

<p>
Dumont&mdash;for the second figure was
manifestly that of the cook&mdash;stood staring at
Dennis as though inviting any hostile movement.
But the third figure suddenly rose in
the water with a great leap&mdash;rose and threw
itself forward, and went caroming down upon
Frenchy, Then the answer came to Dennis&mdash;a
diver from the Jap boat!  Under shelter
of the fog, knowing themselves unseen, the
little brown men had gone to work!
</p>

<p>
And as he realized this, Dennis saw the
figures of the two other divers, plunging
together upon the bottom, abruptly obscured
from his sight by a red mist uprising through
the water.  With horrified comprehension,
Dennis realized that the murderer, Dumont,
had been taken unawares, had been caught in
his own trap&mdash;had cut the lines of one man
only to have an unseen enemy spring upon
him and stab him to death!
</p>

<p>
Dennis turned, and with a wild leap left
the red-smeared scene behind.
</p>

<p>
The whole affair, from the moment he
had heard his helmet valve click, had not
taken twenty seconds, Already there had
sprung into Dennis's brain the comprehension
that he had but one bare slim hope
of salvation&mdash;almost subconsciously he was
aware of it, and almost upon intuition he
leaped upward through the water.  He leaped
not toward the <i>Pelican</i>, where he knew well
that no help awaited him, but away from her;
he leaped toward the shattered and sundered
afterpart of the <i>John Simpson</i>.
</p>

<p>
Speed now meant life.  He could not
reach the shore in time, already&mdash;was it
fact or imagination?&mdash;he fancied that his
breathing was getting more difficult, the
air in his lungs hot and vitiated.  There
came to him the horrible thought of a diver
leaping about the bottom of the sea, leaping
in huge bounds of twenty feet upward,
leaping like a mad crazed animal until the
air in his suit gave out and he dropped
head-foremost in the ooze.  It was a frantic thought.
Upon the heels of it something tugged at
the trailing lifeline and jerked Dennis down
head first.
</p>

<p>
Knife in hand, he recovered his balance,
thinking that the Jap diver had pursued him.
But the trailing end of his line had caught in
some obstruction&mdash;nothing more.  With a
sobbing breath of relief, Dennis slashed
away the line and bore onward with a high
leap.
</p>

<p>
That bound gained the crushed decking of
the <i>John Simpson</i>.  The afterpart of the
wreck lay upon a sharply inclined plane, its
broken forward end upon the bottom, the
stern high in its nest of rocks.  Up that sharp
steep slope crawled Tom Dennis.
</p>

<p>
To maintain his balance and to keep any
foothold upon the slimy decking was difficult.
He clung to the rail with his left hand, slowly
working himself upward.  He dared try no
leaping here, lest like a rubber ball he fly
over the rail with the seaward current and
drop; and if a diver drops thirty feet he is
apt to be crushed all at once into his helmet
by the pressure&mdash;and it would not be nice.
</p>

<p>
"Can't take chances!" thought Dennis,
then laughed inwardly at the notion.  Take
chances!  Why, he was basing his entire
hope of salvation upon chances of which
he was totally uncertain!  It had swiftly
come to him that by gaining the after end
of the wreck, by crawling up her sloping
deck to the stern, he would be out of the
water.  But would he?  How far had the tide
ebbed?  He did not know.  He could not
remember what time the tide had
turned&mdash;whether the wreck would be now uncovered
or not.
</p>

<p>
Then there was the fog; another chance.
If the fog had only slightly lessened, so
those aboard the <i>Pelican</i> could see stern of
the wreck, they would finish their work
with rifles should Dennis emerge.  Thus
there was a double chance against him.
Should he find himself out of water at the
stern of the wreck, his only hope then would
be that the fog still held thick as ever.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
His ears were roaring now, and paining
with an ache that thrummed at each pulse-beat.
The air was steadily growing worse;
Dennis paused to press more air up from his
billowing suit, and gained momentary
relief.
</p>

<p>
It occurred to him that he still had one
friend aboard the <i>Pelican</i>&mdash;the steward.
His knife had been removed purposely;
the steward had noticed its absence; therefore,
the little Cockney was not in on the
murder-scheme.  Dennis laughed slightly and turned
again to his task of climbing.
</p>

<p>
Dragging himself up that slimy steep
decking was hard work, and he cursed the
tremendous weights that held him down;
the buoyancy seemed gone out of him with
his weariness.  Then, suddenly, he came to a
dead halt, straining his eyes to look upward
and ahead, and keen despair went through
him like a knife.
</p>

<p>
He had gained the after hatchway which
was uncovered and yawned in a black hole to
his right.  Directly in front of him was the
overhang of the poop&mdash;an eight-foot wall
which, owing to the position of the wreck,
deserved its name so far as Dennis was
concerned.  It overhung him; in order to go
up the ladder in front of him, Dennis would
have to do it hand over hand, or not at all!
</p>

<p>
For a moment he paused.  Pains had seized
and were racking him.  His throat and lungs
felt afire.  He knew that he could not last
much longer, and with a frightful effort he
flung himself forward; the knife, his sole
means of escape from the diving-suit, he
thrust down into the sheath of his belt,
trusting that it would remain there.
</p>

<p>
Gripping the stairs of the ladder, Dennis
hauled himself up.  He dared spare nothing of
energy or effort now; he was staking all upon
one effort.  If he failed to reach the poop he
was gone.
</p>

<p>
Strangling, gasping spasmodically for the
air that burned out his lungs, he came at
last to the end of the ladder.  He got his head
about it; he could see the poop-deck there
before him, and he writhed desperately
over the edge of the ladder.  With all his
lightness in the water, he nearly failed at
that moment.  For one sickening instant
he felt himself going backward and
down&mdash;then, heaving upward convulsively, he
somehow made it safely.  For a moment he lay
weak and helpless.
</p>

<p>
A spasm of strangulation forced him on.
He groped behind him for his knife, found
it, and pressed forward.  The water was
lighter now&mdash;he was near the top.  How
near?  Unless the stern were clear of the
water, he would be lost.  There was blood
in his throat; his nose and ears were bleeding.
To his terror, he lost his balance and plunged
against the rail, nearly going over.  He
gripped the rail and hauled himself onward.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
A frightful madness seized him, a convulsive
gasping for relief, and he was near to ripping
asunder his diving-suit.  His frantic efforts
had exhausted what little oxygen remained;
he could press up no more good air from his
suit.  Then, suddenly and unexpectedly, he
found that some horrible, deadly, agonizing
weight was pressing him down.  He could see
only the grey dimness around him; red
specks were dancing before his eyes; that
awful weight was oppressing him, and what
caused it, he did not know, unless it were
death.  He came up against the rounded bulge
of the stern-rail.  It was the end.  He could
go no farther.
</p>

<p>
"That ends it!" he thought despairingly.
"The tide hasn't ebbed enough."
</p>

<p>
He fell forward, unable to lift the weight
of that copper helmet, for the oppression
was crushing him down.  He could not make
out what that frightful weight could be, nor
did he care.  He reached up with his knife,
as he lay there, and determined to end things
swiftly.  He refused to be longer tortured.
</p>

<p>
With a swift, reckless motion he ripped
asunder the breast of his diving-suit.
</p>

<p>
To his amazement, nothing happened.
No water entered.  Instead, came a breath
of cold sweet air that literally brought life
into his lungs!
</p>

<p>
Two minutes later he was sitting up,
sobbing the good clean air into his body!
He saw then what had happened&mdash;what that
awful weight had been!  It had been only the
weight of his own body and equipment.
Unknown to himself, he had emerged from
the water into the dense thickness of the fog.
</p>

<p>
He had won clear!

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br /><br />
PONTIFEX PLANS REVENGE
</h3>

<p>
"Strike me blind," observed Bo's'n Joe
gloomily, "if they ain't gone an' got poor
Frenchy!"
</p>

<p>
No one else spoke for a bit.  Mr. Leman
spat over the rail and stared at the fog in
the direction of the unseen Japanese ship.
The Missus had gone to her cabin when the
body was hauled aboard.  Captain Pontifex
stood looking down at the form, still incased
in its diving-suit; and his pallid cavernous
features were venomous with rage.
</p>

<p>
"I'd sooner have lost anyone aboard
rather than Dumont&mdash;except the Missus,"
he said softly.  "And to think they must
have got him just after he got Dennis."
</p>

<p>
"Aye," said Bo's'n Joe.
</p>

<p>
It was very evident how Frenchy had come
by his fate.  Transfixing his body, fastened
so firmly within him that no easy pull
would remove it, was a long-bladed knife
with shark-skin handle&mdash;palpably a Japanese
knife.
</p>

<p>
"Well," the Skipper turned away, "see
that he's sewed up proper, Mr. Leman, and
we'll bury him shipshape.  Attend to
repairing that dress, too."
</p>

<p>
When the skipper had disappeared aft,
Bo's'n Joe looked at Mr. Leman.
</p>

<p>
"What's the Skipper got on his mind?
He ain't goin' to stand by and see Frenchy
killed without doin' anything?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Leman reflectively tugged his whiskers,
and squinted down his broken nose.
</p>

<p>
"Not him, Bo's'n&mdash;not him!  'Ready to
work to-morrow', says he.  Just wait till
to-night, Bo's'n!  If something don't happen
to them Japs, I miss my guess.  Leave it to
him and the Missus!  If this blasted fog don't
break, he'll show 'em a thing or two."
</p>

<p>
The <i>Pelican</i> swung idly to her anchors
all that afternoon.
</p>

<p>
It was easy for those aboard her to deduce
exactly how Dumont had come to his end.
The knife told the whole story.  The flurry
at the end of the lines, Dumont's frantic
signal to be hoisted, all explained perfectly
that he had encountered a diver from the
enemy ship.  The Japs had diving apparatus,
of course.
</p>

<p>
Sullen resentment and fury filled the
<i>Pelican</i>, from skipper to meekest Kanaka.
All aboard had been wildly excited over
salvage and treasure; because of this fact,
Pontifex had a solidly united crew behind him
in whatever he might attempt.  Frenchy had
not been particularly loved, but his murder
showed that the enemy meant business&mdash;and
in defence of their treasure-trove the crew
of the <i>Pelican</i> were only too anxious to
fight.
</p>

<p>
As the afternoon wore on, the fog thickened
rather than lessened.  At the end of the first
dog-watch all hands were called and Frenchy
was committed to the deep, with the usual
bucket of slush.
</p>

<p>
Someone observed that there was no chance
of laying the ghost of Dennis in this customary
fashion; within five minutes the remark had
gone through the brig.  No one cared particularly
how Dennis had perished, but everyone
was superstitious in the extreme.  Mr. Leman
allowed an anxious frown to disturb his flat
countenance, and even the skipper, upon
hearing the rumour, appeared disturbed.
</p>

<p>
"Not that I give two hoots for any
ghost," he confided to the Missus, "but it
makes a bad spirit aboard ship.  Nonsense!
A ghost doesn't come back, anyway."
</p>

<p>
"I've heard 'baout that happening," said
the Missus gloomily but firmly.  "And what
folks believe in is apt to come true.  You
mark my words!"
</p>

<p>
"Then" and the skipper brightened&mdash;"they
say that a death aboard ship always brings
wind&mdash;so we'd better get busy with those
Japs before the fog lifts!"
</p>

<p>
This latter superstition was equally well
known aboard, and predictions were that
before morning the fog would be gone.  Within
another hour, however, everybody aboard was
too busy to bother further with superstitions.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
When darkness began to fall, with no sign
of activity from Captain Pontifex, open
grumbling began to spread along the deck,
It was silenced by the Skipper in person,
who appeared and ordered two of the
whaleboats lowered.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Leman," he commanded quietly,
the entire crew listening tensely, "you'll
take command of one boat.  Lay aboard
her six of those oil-bags from the store-room.
Muffle the oars.  Take a compass and mind
your bearings.  Two of you men lay aft, here."
</p>

<p>
Two of the white hands hastened aft and
followed the Skipper down the companion way.
In five minutes they reappeared, struggling
beneath the weight of the pride of the whaling
fleet&mdash;-the green-striped tea-jar.  It was minus
the big scarlet geranium plant, and should
have been light; but it seemed most
unaccountably heavy.
</p>

<p>
"Easy, there!" snapped the Skipper.
</p>

<p>
"Corny, reeve a rope through that block
at the mains'l yard and sling the jar into
the boat&mdash;not Mr. Leman's boat, but mine.
Bo's'n, lay down there and place her in the
bow."
</p>

<p>
Ericksen seemed not to relish his task
in the least, but he obeyed.  In ten minutes
the jar was safely stowed in the other
whaleboat; from this boat all whaling gear was
now removed, six oars alone being left.
</p>

<p>
"In with you, Corny," commanded the
Skipper.  "You and Ericksen with four
Kanakas will row me out.  Mr. Leman,
precede us very slowly; when you sight that
Jap, lay that oil on the water and then stand
back to pick us up."
</p>

<p>
He turned to salute the Missus with a chaste
kiss upon the cheek.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, my dear!  You insist upon
taking the third boat?"
</p>

<p>
"I reckon I can do as well as yeou,"
returned the Missus impassively.  "Good luck!"
</p>

<p>
"Same to you," answered the Skipper.
</p>

<p>
Six men were at the oars in Mr. Leman's
boat, four more in that of the skipper.
Mrs. Pontifex ordered the forward boat down, and
the five remaining men into her.  To them she
handed rifles, then turned to the trembling
steward.
</p>

<p>
"I'm leavin' yeou to tend ship," she stated
firmly.  "There's a shot-gun beside the helm;
if anybody else boards, yeou let fly!  No
telling but some o' those Japs might ha'
worked araound by the shore&mdash;but we'll
give 'em something else to think abaout."
</p>

<p>
With that, she descended into her boat,
compass in hand, ordered her rowers to give
way, and vanished into the darkness of the
fog&mdash;not following the Skipper, but departing at
a tangent from his course.
</p>

<p>
The steward hastened to the quarter-deck,
secured the shot-gun, and perched upon the
rail.
</p>

<p>
The Cockney was by no means lacking in
acuteness.  He had been cleaning up a muss
in the stern cabin for the last half-hour;
he knew that this muss was the debris from
several ammunition packets, broken from
the packing-case of ammunition that had
been hauled in upon the morning previous.
He knew that the scarlet geranium had been
transplanted into a keg.  He knew that this
keg had previously been full of gunpowder;
he knew likewise that the skipper had
laboriously fashioned a fuse&mdash;and that the tide
was now going out.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
So as he perched upon the starboard taffrail
and scrutinized the blank fog, the steward
had a fairly certain idea of what to expect.
</p>

<p>
"Gawd 'elp them yeller swine!" he
observed reflectively.  "Skipper's going to lye
out that oil; it'll drift around 'em wi'
the tide.  That's what 'e was w'iting for,
the hold fox!  When the oil 'as got hall
haround that ship, skipper sends 'is boat
at 'er.  Ho!  Then 'e gets off in Mr. Leman's
boat, first lightin' the fuse.  Then 'e lights the
oil.  Oil an' fuse&mdash;and then the jar o'
powder&mdash;blime, but 'e's a fox, a ruddy fox!  Ho!
And then the Missus she takes a 'and&mdash;only I
bet skipper 'e don't know as 'ow that fusee
is dry!  Thinks it's wet as when 'e made it,
'e does!  Well, wait an' see&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
His reflections ended in a chuckle.  The
steward, having no personal anticipation of
danger, cared not a snap what went on out in
the mist; in fact, he looked forward to a very
enjoyable time.
</p>

<p>
The tide had turned, right enough, and
was strongly on the ebb.  Rolling himself a
cigarette, the steward stretched along the
rail and waited comfortably; he could feel
the ship lift and tug and vibrate as the pull
of the tide-current swung her on the taunt
hawsers from stem and stern.  The steward
watched the dim banks of fog with lazy
anticipation.  He was in the position of a
front-seat spectator, and was determined to
have a good time.
</p>

<p>
Thus, being intent upon the fog, waiting
for the first flare of yellow flame and the first
wild yell of alarm, the steward relaxed all
vigilance as regarded his own surroundings.
He was no seaman, and when the <i>Pelican</i>
gave a queer little sideways lurch, he merely
shifted his position slightly and reflected that
a wave must have struck her.  Still there came
no sound from the fog, no token of flaring oil
or fighting men.  The steward lighted his
cigarette and reflected that emptying the oil
bags seemed to take considerable time.
</p>

<p>
It was perhaps five minutes later that a
queer sound came from forward&mdash;a sound
not unlike the breaking of a lax violin string,
but deeper.  The steward did not hear it at
all; but a seaman would have known that
somewhere a taut cable had parted.  When the
brigantine began to rock gently and evenly,
the steward took for granted that there must
be a ground-swell or something of that sort.
</p>

<p>
Behind the steward moved a queer grotesque
figure&mdash;a figure that might have been
some strange nightmare shape moving silently
in the darkness; a figure with enormous and
bulbous head which rocked upon its shoulders
in monstrous and uncanny fashion.  The figure
came to a pause just behind the steward whose
position was rendered quite certain by the
cigarette spark.
</p>

<p>
"Put up your hands!" snapped a voice suddenly.
</p>

<p>
The steward tumbled backward off the
rail and plumped down on the deck.  A
faint howl of terror escaped him as he stared
up at the grotesque, horribly-shaped figure
whose bulk was intensified by the fog.
The figure stood over him, and a rifle poked
him in the ribs.
</p>

<p>
"'Ave mercy!" howled the terrified
steward.  "I'm a poor, innercent man&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's <i>you</i>!  Didn't know you, steward,"
said the voice of Dennis.  "Where's everybody?
Get up, old boy&mdash;I'll not hurt you!"
</p>

<p>
But, recognizing the voice of Dennis, the
steward could only emit a horrified gasp.
</p>

<p>
"Don't 'a'nt me, sir!" he pleaded, folding
his hands and getting to his knees in desperate
fear.  "I didn't 'ave nothink to do wif it,
sir&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens, I'm no ghost!" Dennis
laughed.  "Where's the skipper?"
</p>

<p>
"Gone, sir," quavered the steward.  "Heverybody's
gone."
</p>

<p>
"Where?"
</p>

<p>
"To fight that 'ere Jap ship, sir."
</p>

<p>
"You're all alone on board?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
Dennis broke into laughter, dropped his
rifle and seized the hand of the steward,
pulling him erect.
</p>

<p>
"Here, man, don't be afraid!" he
exclaimed.  "I'm solid flesh and blood.  But
you'll have to unscrew this helmet&mdash;the
thing's killing me, and I can't get rid of it.
I've cut off the rest of the suit&mdash;take hold,
now!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Dennis sat down on the deck.  Trembling
still, the steward unfastened the catches of
the helmet and unscrewed the big tinned-copper
globe.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but that feels good!" sighed Dennis,
"I could open the front sight, but I couldn't
get the thing off.  Now the corselet&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
A moment later Dennis stood erect, gingerly
feeling his neck and shoulders.  Suddenly
he laughed again and seized the steward's
hand.
</p>

<p>
"Shake, old man!" he exclaimed heartily.
"So they're all off fighting the Japs, eh?
Mrs. Pontifex too?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"And you didn't know that I'd cut the
old ship adrift&mdash;and that we're outward
bound with the tide?"
</p>

<p>
The poor steward gave a violent start,
and stared around; but the shroud of fog
was too dense.
</p>

<p>
"Drifting, sir?" he uttered fearfully.  "And
what'll the skipper do?"
</p>

<p>
"I should worry!"  Dennis chuckled.  "See
here, steward&mdash;I know you weren't in on the
plan to murder me; your giving me the knife
proved that.  So we'll stick together, old
man, and if we get out of this, I'll see
that <i>you</i> come out on top.
</p>

<p>
"Well, after Dumont cut my lines, I
got out on the stern of the wreck, above
the water; with your knife I got rid of most
of the diving suit, and managed to get ashore.
Two boats filled with Japs came ashore about
dark, not knowing I was there.  They landed,
probably meaning to attack the <i>Pelican</i>
later.  But I shoved out their boats, and came
aboard ship in one of them&mdash;got their rifles
too."
</p>

<p>
He laughed heartily.  "See here, steward&mdash;the
Japs are marooned on the island!
The Skipper is out attacking their schooner.
Meantime, we're drifting out to sea,
and&mdash;what's the answer?"
</p>

<p>
"Blime, sir!"  The steward gaped at him.
"It's mortal queer!"
</p>

<p>
"It will be&mdash;for somebody," said Dennis
grimly.  "Now get me something to eat."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir.  This way, sir."  The steward,
still but half-conscious of what had taken
place, turned toward the galley.
</p>

<p>
At that instant a fearful yell arose from
somewhere in the mist; a yell that quavered
up and died quickly.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The steward halted, gazing over the
starboard counter; but the ship had swung and
was going out with the tide.  It was over the
port bow that a wild flare of light glimmered.
Dennis saw it and cried:
</p>

<p>
"The fools!  They've set her afire!"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, it's the oil!"  Breathlessly the
steward explained the Skipper's plan of attack.
Before he had finished, the flare of light
widened into a broad stream, lighting all
the fog redly.  With it sounded renewed
yells&mdash;shrill piercing yells.
</p>

<p>
Then, off to one side, broke forth a
crackle of rifles.  That was the boat of the
Missus, cleverly pumping bullets at the Jap
ship from a wide angle.  Through this burst a
volume of hoarse shouts, followed almost at
once by a single terrific detonation&mdash;the
thunderous shock of which sent the <i>Pelican</i>
reeling and shuddering.  The green-striped
jar had exploded.
</p>

<p>
After that one bursting, rending, shattering
crash, a swift darkness ensued.  Through
this blackness pierced fragmentary glimmers
as the scattered and far-flung oil blazed up
here and there, only fitfully to perish again.
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens!" exclaimed Dennis,
awed and astounded.  "Old Pontifex got
more than he bargained for in that bomb,
or I miss my guess!"
</p>

<p>
The <i>Pelican</i> was already past the scene
of the explosion.  What had happened there
in the fog, could not be told.  Whether the
enemy ship had been shattered, or whether
the whaleboats had themselves caught the
force of the explosion, could not be discovered.
All was silence and darkness from that quarter.
But from far astern, lifted a chorus of faintly
quavering yells as the marooned Japs on
the island discovered the loss of their boats.
Save for this, all was hushed and still.
</p>

<p>
"Well, steward," said Dennis in the
silence.  "Let's get that grub.  I need it."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," responded the steward meekly.
</p>

<p>
And the <i>Pelican</i> drifted out upon the tide,
swinging and heaving gently to the slow swells
that rocked up through the fog.  It was an
hour later that the first breath of air
came&mdash;the wind which, as sailors say, always comes
after death.
</p>

<p><a id="chap14"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br /><br />
THEY THAT TAKE THE SWORD&mdash;
</h3>

<p>
A glorious sunrise broke across the ocean,
lifting the island peaks to the north into a
sheen of purple-rose and gold.  Dennis
wakened to it&mdash;he had gone to sleep stretched
out upon a blanket on the quarter-deck&mdash;with
a thrill of sheer delight in the golden
splendour overhead; then he realized that the
steward was calling him, and he leaped up.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Pelican</i> with her canvas all housed,
had been but little influenced by the breeze
from the north-west.  She had made leeway,
drifting a couple of miles from her late
anchorage; having no glasses at hand, Dennis
could not tell whether the Jap ship still lay
by the island or not.
</p>

<p>
"There's a boat tacking down to us, sir!"
rang out the steward's voice from forward.
</p>

<p>
Dennis glimpsed her at once, and saw that
she must be a fishing-boat&mdash;a sturdy, bluff
little craft which seemed to carry but two
people, As he looked, he saw her brown
canvas flutter down; she was coming from the
north-east, and when her canvas was stowed
she headed directly for the <i>Pelican</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Got a motor, eh?" reflected Dennis.
</p>

<p>
He swung down the companion way and
located the binoculars of the skipper.  With
these he returned to the deck.  Caring less
about the fishing-boat than about conditions
at the island, he picked up the latter point
first; the steward had joined him and stood
waiting for disclosures.
</p>

<p>
There was no ship in sight, much to the
surprise of Dennis.  Nor could he make out
any sign of life upon the rocky crags of the
island itself.  About a mile distant from the
brigantine he located a boat floating bottom-side
up.  It was a whaleboat, and as it swung
around with the seas Dennis made out the
figure two painted at its bows.
</p>

<p>
"That's the boat Mr. Leman took last
night, blime if it ain't!" ejaculated the
steward, upon learning its number from
Dennis.  "Nothin' else in sight sir?"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;hold on!" Dennis caught something
adrift toward the north end of the island.
"By thunder, there's another boat&mdash;she seems
to be standing out this way.  There's
someone aboard her; they're getting up a sail.
Seems to be only two or three of them&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"That fishin boat is 'eading this w'y,
sir," broke in the steward.  "Shall I pass 'er?"
</p>

<p>
"By all means," responded Dennis, and
turned his glasses toward the craft.
</p>

<p>
Amazement thrilled within him&mdash;amazement,
and startled unbelief.  One figure
aboard her was huddled over the engine amidships
and could not be discerned; but in the
stern, wonder of wonders, sat Florence!
</p>

<p>
There could be no mistake about it.  She
was heavily wrapped in fur robes, but Dennis
saw her face sharply and distinctly&mdash;her pale
eager features, her brown eyes fastened upon
the whaler, her fur-gloved hand upon the
tiller of the boat.  With a wild yell of delight
Tom Dennis leaped up, waving his arms,
and he saw Florence wave back response.
</p>

<p>
"It's my wife, steward&mdash;hurrah!" Dennis
ran forward to aid the Cockney.  "She must
have come all the way from Unalaska in that
boat!  Here, get your line ready by the diver's
ladder in the waist; it'll be an easy climb
there.  Great glory, what a surprise!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," returned the steward, adding:
"And werry lucky hit is, sir, as she didn't
get 'ere larst night!"
</p>

<p>
"You bet," said Dennis devoutly.  "Thank
Heaven for the fog&mdash;it must have prevented
their trying to make the island!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
As the fishing craft drew in toward the
whaler, Dennis recognized the man at her
engine&mdash;it was the same grizzled fisherman
whom he had hired to pick up Jerry.  The
fisherman shut off his engine and came in to
the bow to receive the line which the steward
flung; the boat drew in beside the drifting
<i>Pelican</i>.  Florence, rising stiffly, was aided
to the ladder by her bronzed helper, and a
moment later Dennis held her in his arms.
</p>

<p>
"What on earth!" he exclaimed, as she
broke into mingled tears and laughter.
"What brought you here, dearest?"
</p>

<p>
"You, Tom!" she exclaimed.  "Jerry
told us that they meant to send you down in a
diving-suit and&mdash;and&mdash;oh, I'm glad we're
not too late!  Captain Nickers has been a
darling, Tom&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Dennis shook hands with the fisherman,
who grinned and eyed the ship.
</p>

<p>
"Looks kind o' fussed up, don't she?"
said Nickers.  "Where's everybody?"
</p>

<p>
Florence glanced around quickly.  "Oh!
Where are they, Tom?  Quick, you must
get away&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Take it easy," said Dennis, and pointed
to the whaleboat standing down the wind
toward them.  "Where they are, <i>I</i> don't know!
Lots of things have happened.  So you came
all this way to give me warning?"
</p>

<p>
"You bet," said Nickers.  "Say, Dennis,
if I had a wife like you have&mdash;by gum, I'd
give a million dollars!  That run over here
ain't no cinch for a lady, let me tell you;
but she stood watch an' watch with me like
an old hand&mdash;well, she's a wonder!"
</p>

<p>
"We had to," Florence laughed, flushing
under the ardent words of grizzled old Nickers.
"I was terribly afraid for you, Tom, and there
was no one else we could get&mdash;but tell us,
what's happened?"
</p>

<p>
Dennis glanced at the approaching boat
and saw that she would not reach them for
ten minutes.  So, dispatching the steward
to make ready some coffee, he gave Florence
and Nickers a brief outline of the situation,
making light of his own peril.
</p>

<p>
"Where the Japs are," he concluded,
"I've not the faintest idea.  And I can't figure
out what happened last night&mdash;where Pontifex
and the others went.  I don't believe he
blew up the Jap ship, for I can't see any signs
of wreckings except Mr. Leman's boat.
Well, here's this boat coming in.  What's
that in her stern, Nickers?"
</p>

<p>
Having dropped his glasses in the excitement
of getting Florence aboard Dennis could
make out only that the approaching whaleboat
was manned by three Kanakas of the <i>Pelican's</i>
crew, but in her stern was a queer shapeless
mass that looked strangely terrible.
Across the thwarts forward lay two silent
brown figures, inanimate and evidently dead.
It was manifest that from this boat there was
nothing to fear.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Tom!"  Florence caught Dennis'
arm, a wild thrill in her voice.  "In the
stern&mdash;it's Mrs. Pontifex."
</p>

<p>
One of the Kanakas stepped forward across
the dead bodies of his two comrades and
bawled for a line as the boat's sail whipped
down.  Nickers flung another rope, and the
whaleboat came in beside the fishing craft.
Then, for the first time, Mrs. Pontifex
stirred&mdash;and Dennis saw that her head was swathed
in bandages.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The Kanakas, frightened and trembling
at the appearance of Dennis whom they had
thought dead, came aboard aiding the Missus.
Their story was a ghastly one.  At the first
flame of blazing oil, they had opened fire upon
the Jap vessel, obeying orders previously given
them by the Missus.  But their firing had
ceased with the explosion; it had stunned
them.  They had wakened to find two of their
number dead&mdash;and the Missus blind.
</p>

<p>
All that night they had lain rocking to the
swells after vainly trying to find the <i>Pelican</i>.
The Jap ship had gone.  They had heard men
swimming out to her from shore, and had
caught the sound of oars; then her motor had
started.  It was very plain that the Japs had
been thoroughly frightened, and after picking
up their men ashore had turned and run for it.
</p>

<p>
Florence, meantime, had aided the groaning
Mrs. Pontifex to get below.
</p>

<p>
To his queries, Dennis could elicit no
response from the Kanakas regarding Mr. Leman
or Pontifex.  They had landed at dawn, but
had found the island deserted.  Seeing the
<i>Pelican</i> to leeward; they had set out to join
her, passing on the way the floating whaleboat.
They identified it beyond question as Mr. Leman's
boat.
</p>

<p>
The steward came up with pannikins of
coffee during the talk, and now broke into
the discussion.
</p>

<p>
"Beg pardon, sir," he said to Dennis,
"but I think as I know what 'appened, sir."
</p>

<p>
"You do?  Then out with it!"
</p>

<p>
"Like this, sir.  The skipper, e' myde
'is own fusee for that 'ere bomb, and I
seen 'im a-myking of it.  'E rolled it wet,
sir, but 'e myde it in the hafternoon, sir,
and before 'e come to use it larst night, the
bloody fussee 'ad dried out, sir.  So when
'e lighted it, why, it wasn't no fusee at all,
but a regular train o' powder, sir&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Dennis turned away, sickened by the
thought of what must have happened.  The
explosion must have taken place almost
instantly&mdash;no wonder Mr. Leman's boat was
floating bottom upward!  Pontifex and
Ericksen and Corny and the others&mdash;all gone!
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Nickers phlegmatically, sipping
his hot coffee, "all I got to say, looks
like old Pontifex got what he was fixing to
give other folks.  Hey?"
</p>

<p>
Dennis nodded and left the spot.  Getting
coffee and biscuits from the steward, he went
to the after companion way; but at the top of
the ladder he encountered Florence coming
up alone.
</p>

<p>
"I'll take this to Mrs. Pontifex&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No use, Tom," Florence stopped him,
her face very pale.  "Poor thing, she can't
eat yet; Tom, she broke down in my
arms&mdash;oh, I can't talk of it!  The poor
woman&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Dennis forced a draught of coffee upon her,
and Florence swallowed the hot liquid.  It
sent a glow of colour into her pale cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"So she's broken, eh?" mused Dennis.
"Poor thing&mdash;one can't help but feel sorry
for her, Florence, and yet in a way she
deserved all that has happened.  Look here,
what are we going to do?  About ourselves,
I mean, and this ship, and the salvage."
</p>

<p>
He briefly explained what must have
happened to Pontifex and Mr. Leman, glossing
over the event as much as possible.  But
Florence seemed not to hear.  She stood at the
rail, gazing out at the purple peaks to the
north for a long while.  Suddenly she turned
back to him, a faint smile upon her lips.
</p>

<p>
"Tom, the first thing will be to straighten
everything out at Unalaska!  Before I left,
I told the authorities everything.  They're
trying to get the revenue cutter, but we shan't
need her now, of course.
</p>

<p>
"We can charter this ship from
Mrs. Pontifex&mdash;it'll give the poor woman some
money to go on&mdash;for a share in the proceeds of
the salvage.  Then we can come back and
clear up everything in father's old ship&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Agreed."  Dennis turned.  "Oh, Cap'n
Nickers!  Think we can take this craft into
Unalaska with what hands we have?"
</p>

<p>
"Reckon we can," floated back the voice of
the grizzled fisherman.  "I got a Master's
ticket, and if I can't lay a course there's
something wrong with the Gov'ment!"
</p>

<p>
Dennis looked eagerly to Florence.  "We'll
make him skipper&mdash;eh?  And we'll give him
a share in the profits, too&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Her arms crept about his shoulders.  "Oh,
Tom&mdash;we'll do <i>everything</i>, won't we?  But
you'll never leave me behind again."
</p>

<p>
"Not much!"  Dennis pressed his lips to
hers, and laughed softly.
</p>

<h3>
THE CONCLUSION
<br /><br />
OUTWARD BOUND
</h3>

<p>
Four months after Tom Dennis had vanished
from Marshville, the dingy and shut-up office
of <i>The Clarion</i> was reopened.  Dennis had
returned&mdash;and he had not returned alone.
The mortgage held by banker Dribble
was cancelled.  A new linotype machine
was installed in <i>The Clarion's</i> dingy back
room.  The first issue of the paper announced
that it was back again to stay.  And it
stayed!
</p>

<p>
Also, some very good farms along the
river were purchased by a gentleman named
Nickers.  Mr. Nickers announced that he
was a retired sea-captain and was now
about to take up the profession of farming
Mother Earth&mdash;the dream of every
sea-faring man alive.
</p>

<p>
Each afternoon at five minutes of two,
Mr. Nickers would stride down the street
and enter the office of <i>The Clarion</i>.  The
wide front office was now divided into two
rooms.  Mr. Nickers invariably passed to
the second room and entered, closing the
door behind him.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon, however, he came slightly
earlier than usual.  Tom Dennis, who was
in the second room, shook hands heartily.
In the corner by the window that
overlooked Main Street sat a man of huge
physique and massive features; this man
was able to move only with difficulty and
by aid of a stick.  Miles Hathaway would
never be the man he had been, but at least
he could get about.  Modern surgeons can
do much that appears miraculous to the
layman.
</p>

<p>
Hathaway held up his big fist and
exchanged a hearty grip with Nickers; then
he lifted a rugged booming voice in a
shout that rattled the plate-glass window.
</p>

<p>
"Jerry!  Where's that&mdash;  Oh, here you are!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," meekly responded a moon-faced
lad, popping in at the door.  He was
clad in printer's apron and had a very dirty
face, as is the rightful heritage of every
printer's devil who is yet passing through
the "type lice" jest of hoary memory.  But
he was manifestly a very happy boy.
</p>

<p>
"Strike four bells!" roared Miles Hathaway.
"And fetch my pipe and tobacco."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Dennis beckoned to Jerry and whispered
something.  The boy struck a brass ship's
bell of the regulation eight-inch size which
hung near the door&mdash;struck it one-two,
one-two, as a ship's bell should be struck,
then vanished hastily.  He had barely gone
when Florence came into the room, with
a smile and a kiss for everybody
concerned&mdash;which seemed to mightily embarrass
Captain Nickers but not to displease him
particularly!
</p>

<p>
Florence started to speak, then halted
as Jerry re-entered the room bearing a tray
with glasses and a long green bottle.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Tom!" she exclaimed quickly.
"You're not drinking?"
</p>

<p>
"We're all drinking to-day&mdash;and you'll
have to take a sip at least!" said Dennis,
laughing.  He produced a corkscrew and
opened the bottle.  "News for you, Florence!
Now, Jerry, fill 'em all around&mdash;and a
specially big one for Cap'n Nickers!"
</p>

<p>
Wondering, Florence watched Jerry obey
the order.  Then Tom Dennis, lifting his
glass, met her puzzled eyes with a gay
laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Good news, Florence!  Two things have
happened this morning.  First, the other
paper has offered to sell out to us&mdash;and
I'm going to accept their offer, running it
as a weekly from now on.  That means no
opposition here.  And second, I've signed
a whopping advertising contract with one
of the biggest agencies&mdash;it came in the mail
this morning.  Ladies and gentlemen, that
means that from this time forward <i>The
Clarion</i> is not only established firmly here
in town, but she begins to haul in the coin!
</p>

<p>
"I've made mistakes," pursued Dennis
more soberly.  "I made 'em when I was
here before, and I've profited by them.
Beginning with next Monday's issue <i>The
Clarion</i> dies for ever!  Beginning with next
Monday its place will be taken by <i>The
Marshville Pelican</i>&mdash;and here's to the new
ship!"
</p>

<p>
"Hurray!" said Cap'n Nickers.  But
Florence turned to her husband.
</p>

<p>
"And Tom," she said softly, "you'll have
to find a new society editor.  I&mdash;I'm going
to stay at home after this and&mdash;and make
a real home for you!"
</p>

<p>
Of all those who heard her words Tom
Dennis alone understood&mdash;and perhaps Miles
Hathaway understood also.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
